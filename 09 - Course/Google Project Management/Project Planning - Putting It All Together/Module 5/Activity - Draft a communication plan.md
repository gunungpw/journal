## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a communication plan to help you manage all the different kinds of communication that happen during a project. Communication plans help you organize recipients, communication frequency, and the types of information you need to share.

_**Note:**_ _When you create a communication plan at the start of a project, don’t feel obligated to follow it exactly. Communications should be flexible enough to adapt if and when circumstances change._

## Scenario

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hVmbXqU4TfaZm16lOP323g_e4c571928fbb4117a547fc86e8c5a886_line-y.png?expiry=1715644800000&hmac=pKiT9Je0eqqEPHn8SpnTPnIW8K4YfXa3WvJINsriB9U)

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As part of the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan, your team will need to organize and host trainings for employees. You want to make sure that a majority of employees are properly trained to use the new software and equipment before sending the first round of Plant Pals test batches to customers. Because your employees will need to learn several different processes, training sessions will take place over a period of ten days. Your team has just over three weeks to prepare before the sessions begin.

As the Plant Pals project manager, you will work with your team to plan and execute the preparations for the training sessions. One of your tasks is to build a communication plan, which should include:

- **What** you need to communicate (the goal of the communication)
    
- **Who** needs to communicate
    
- **When** information-sharing needs to happen
    
- **Why and how** to communicate with everyone involved
    

As you begin planning the training sessions, you identify the key teams and stakeholders who will need to communicate about the event:

**Core Team**: Your core project team will lead the planning and task coordination. These tasks include communicating with stakeholders, preparing the schedule, reserving space and equipment, training the employees, and more.

The team members who are directly involved in organizing the trainings include:

- An **Administrative Coordinator** who is responsible for scheduling and communicating with external vendors and Office Green teams (e.g., Facilities)
    
- A **Human Resources Specialist** who manages hiring and develops training protocols (with the help of the Training Manager)
    
- A **Training Manager** who reports to the HR Specialist, runs the training program on the established protocols, and refines training processes
    

The other members of your core project team (the **Financial Analyst**, **Fulfillment Director**, **Quality Assurance Tester**, and **Inventory Manager**) will attend team meetings and are available to pitch in if you need them.

Additional stakeholders with whom your team needs to communicate include:

**Software and Equipment Vendor:** Members of your team will need to meet with the vendor to learn about the software and equipment so they can create an effective training plan for employees. The team members responsible for creating and running the training program should organize and attend this meeting. Your team should allow adequate time to learn about new processes and ask follow-up questions. This meeting must take place before the end of the vendor’s SoW.

**Human Resources**: The Human Resources department can help your team as they develop the training plan. They will also provide support during the training sessions. Your team will want to communicate with them regularly (but not daily) and on an as-needed basis. The HR Specialist on your team is the point of contact for the rest of HR.

**Facilities**: Facilities will reserve and manage the spaces and equipment needed for the training sessions. They will need to review the schedule and understand your needs for each session ahead of time. A member of your team needs to keep them updated and informed of any changes to requirements.

**Print Shop:** The vendor who will install the software and equipment is also creating training manuals for your team. One of your team members will need to coordinate with the print shop to make copies of the manuals for each training.

**Office Green employees:** You will also need to coordinate with the employees who need to be trained! A member of your team should tell them where they should arrive, where they should go, what they need to bring, and communicate other necessary details. The same team member will also need to conduct the sessions and solicit feedback from employees through a post-training survey.

**Your Office Green Manager:** Your manager wants to be kept informed of your team’s progress but doesn't need to know every detail. They can also be a helpful resource for the planning process, if necessary. You already communicate with them regularly, so you can update them at one of your weekly meetings. 

**Senior Leadership**: Your manager asks you to let senior leadership know about the outcome of the trainings (and to copy them when you do so). The Director of Operations and the Director of Product (the project sponsor) want to be kept informed but don’t have much time for meetings.

**Step 2: Review the communication goals and recipients**

The goal and recipient of each communication is already filled out in the template. Review this information and consider the people and teams you need to coordinate. Then try to think of some ways you can effectively communicate about each goal.

_**Note:**_ _The first line of the communication plan has already been filled in. You can reference this information as you complete the rest of the plan._

**Step 3: Determine communication types**

How should you communicate about each goal? What type of communication is best for each recipient? Select one of the following communication types from the drop-down under **Type of Communication**:

- _Planning Meetings:_ Standard meetings with team members or stakeholders to plan event details
    
- _Planning Check-In:_ Brief meetings with stakeholders and support staff to discuss action items or check on task progress
    
- _Training:_ Sessions for employees to learn about jobs or specialized tasks
    
- _Informational update:_ Key details, instructions, and resources for trainees
    
- _Status Update:_ Timely project updates for senior stakeholders to get high-level information, give feedback, and answer questions
    

_**Note:**_ _You can use drop-down items more than once. For example, you might want to build multiple planning check-ins into your schedule._

**Step 4: Determine the frequency**

How often do you need to communicate with each recipient? Consider each stakeholder’s level of involvement in the project when deciding how often to communicate. Select one of the following frequencies from the drop-downs under **Frequency**:

- Daily
    
- Weekly
    
- One time
    

_**Note:**_ _You can treat these frequencies as approximate since you’ll be able make note of other communications (like day-of reminders) under the_ _**Key Dates**_ _column in_ _**Step 6**__._

**Step 5: Add the sender or owner**

Who from the team should share or communicate about this information? Select one of the following options from the drop-downs under **Sender/Owner**:

- Project Manager (you)
    
- Core Team: Administrative Coordinator
    
- Core Team: HR Specialist
    
- Core Team: Training Manager
    
- Core Team: HR Specialist & Training Manager
    

**Step 6: Add the key dates**

When should this communication happen? Are there important reminders or deadlines you should note? Consider how much time you have to plan the event and when it makes sense to communicate about each goal (e.g., early or late in the day or the week). Enter your selected times under **Key Dates**.

There are no right answers here, but try to be specific about times and dates—and make sure your stakeholders don’t need to be in two places at once! 

_**Note:**_ _Your stakeholders’ schedules will vary, and it’s unlikely that they will all be able to make every scheduled meeting. Sometimes, you will need to decide whether you need to reschedule if a key team member can’t make it._

**Step 7: Determine the delivery method**

How will you or your team members share this information? Should you meet in person or over the phone? Should you send a personal email or is a group message more effective? Select your delivery methods from the drop-downs under **Delivery Method**: 

- In person
    
- Phone call
    
- Email (from individual address)
    
- Email (from company address)
    

_**Note:**_ _The best delivery method for each communication depends on the needs and preferences of particular stakeholders. For this exercise, you can use your best judgment._ 

**Step 8 (Optional): Add resources and notes**

If you’d like, fill in the **Resources** and **Notes** columns. You can consult the scenario for any important details or come up with your own. 

For example, the template includes a link to the meeting agenda and notes for daily team meetings. These documents aren’t specifically mentioned in the scenario, but they’re useful for any project meeting.

You don’t need to complete both of these fields for every communication item. Instead, try to think about what kinds of resources or information can help you reach your communication goals. 

## What to Include in Your Response

Compare the exemplar to your completed deliverable. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

_**Note:**_ _Your communication plan may differ from this exemplar. That’s because communication types, frequency, and delivery methods can change depending on the situation, schedules, personal preference, etc. What should always be consistent is your attention to your stakeholders’ roles, needs, and communication styles. Learning about your team is crucial to creating an effective communication plan._

Let’s examine how the different parts of the scenario fit into the communication plan

**Planning Meetings with the Core Team**: Since the core team is directly involved in planning and executing the trainings, you want to meet with them daily and in person. The goal is to check in with each member about their progress, troubleshoot any issues, and make sure everyone stays on track. Your manager can also be a planning resource, so you make sure to schedule the team meetings later in the day than your weekly meeting with your manager. You make a note to check in with your manager with questions and link to the meeting agendas and notes.

**Software & Equipment Vendor**: Since your HR Specialist and Training Manager will plan and run the trainings, they will both need to meet with the vendor. They allow a half-day for this meeting, which will give them time to go over the training manual and ask follow-up questions. You link to the vendor’s Statement of Work and make a note to remind the HR Specialist and Training Manager to check in with relevant team members after the meeting.

**Human Resources**: Your HR Specialist owns communications with the HR department, and checks in with them weekly and in-person for project planning assistance. Since HR will also provide support during trainings, you'll want to send them reminder emails as well. You note that more communications will likely be necessary on an as-needed basis.

**Planning Check-ins with Facilities**: Facilities needs to know the training schedule and requirements, but does not need daily updates. The Administrative Coordinator checks in with them weekly over the phone (but could also meet with them in person). You link to the forms you need to request rooms and equipment for the training sessions.

**Planning Check-ins with the Print Shop**: The Print Shop needs to know the details of the event, but you may not need to check in with them every day. The initial planning meeting is the most important, after which weekly check-ins (over the phone or in person) will suffice. Your Administrative Coordinator takes care of these communications. You link to the printing request forms you will use to order the training manuals.

**Informational Updates for Office Green employees**: You want to communicate with the trainees consistently so they remember when to arrive, where to go, and what to bring. Your Training Manager sends a group email from an official Office Green account each week and sends a reminder the day before each group’s training session. That’s a lot of messages to keep track of, so you make a note for the Training Manager to automate the reminder emails.

**Training for Office Green employees**: The Training Manager will also run the in-person trainings, which are scheduled each day for ten days, beginning at 10:00 AM. You make sure to link to the training schedule, so that it’s easily accessible.

**Survey for Office Green employees**: Once the training sessions are complete, the Training Manager will send the trainees a survey via email (with two follow-up reminders). You make a note to discuss the results at the next team meeting.

**Status Update with your manager**: Since your manager wants to be kept informed of your progress, you decide to update them at your weekly, in-person meeting. You make a note to come prepared with a brief update and specific questions for your manager.

**Status Update with Senior Leaders**: Since the Director of Operations and the Director of Product want to know how the trainings went, you send them an email update (and CC your manager) once they have concluded. You link to the resources you’ll need to create your report.
