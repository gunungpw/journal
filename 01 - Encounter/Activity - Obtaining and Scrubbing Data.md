# Activity Introduction

This week you’ve been learning about obtaining and scrubbing data. This exercise is the first of three activities that will be combined at the end of the course to create a cohesive exhibition of your work. 

We’re providing you with a Course Exercise Templates Document for you to complete these activities. You will access this template in Step 1 of the Activity Instructions below.

Obtaining and Scrubbing data are the first two steps in the OSEMN process. Regardless of the tools you use, the data you’re working with, or the goal of the process, this will always be the best way to start a project. Collecting data for analysis and making sure it’s cleaned and usable is critical to the success of any data analysis project. 

For this first project exercise, you will review a scenario regarding Anna from BrightThreads. You will review the scenario and provide your thoughts on what data would be helpful in a project like this. Then, you will review some data in need of cleaning and suggest how you would scrub it. You will put all of your answers into the Course Exercise Templates Document.

### **Step 2: Access the activity dataset**

There are two options to access the dataset for this activity:

- If you have a Google account, access [the activity dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pYhNUBH4D96rbnEH5s1eUTVr6Bp_Qytj4AZ5KKMsDE/template/preview) and click Use Template in the upper right corner. 
    
- If you do not have a Google account, download an [Excel version of the Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pYhNUBH4D96rbnEH5s1eUTVr6Bp_Qytj4AZ5KKMsDE/export?format=xlsx).
    

### **Step 3: Review the scenario**

Anna owns a clothing boutique in New York, called BrightThreads. She sells a mix of clothing brands and chooses items for her store that she believes her clients will like. She also sells online. 

Anna is working on long-term planning for the upcoming year at BrightThreads. Business has been going well, but she would really like to increase sales and potentially open up a second location in a different neighborhood. Next year, Anna would like to increase her total sales by 10%. This would be a very good year for Anna and BrightThreads, and this goal seems doable based on the last few quarters and with some hard work. 

### **Step 4: Answer the questions related to the Obtain stage of the OSEMN process**

Use the provided template accessed in step 1 to answer the following questions:

- In this scenario, what is a SMART goal that would benefit from data analysis?   
    
- What is a Primary KPI that would be useful to analyze for this goal?   
    
- What relevant data would you gather in this scenario?   
    
- How do you imagine you could obtain this data? What sources would you gather data from? Specifically, note what kind of data (first-party, third-party) and what methods you might use (survey, web analytics).   
    

### **Step 5: Answer the questions related to the Scrub stage of the OSEMN process**

Use the provided dataset accessed in step 2 and the template to answer the following questions:

- Using what you know about data validity, do you think this data is valid? Why or why not?  
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 1 of the data?   
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 2 of the data?   
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 3 of the data?   
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 4 of the data?   
    

### **Step 6: Save your work**

Save your work in the Course Activity Templates Document.
