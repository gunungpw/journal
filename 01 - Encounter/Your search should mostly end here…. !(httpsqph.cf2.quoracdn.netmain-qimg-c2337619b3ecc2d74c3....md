These are my scores withÂ less than 12 daysÂ of serious preparation and without any coaching.

Background

- Booked for TOEFL exactly one month from then - 23rd July  
- Alongside my preps I had aÂ full-time demanding job, so could shell out a max 2hrs a day.

Tips and resources to prepare

It might sound a little cliche, but TOEFL is actually really easy.

Iâ€™ve spent around 3â€“4 days just understanding TOEFL and assimilating resources, which Iâ€™ll list here and mention how Iâ€™ve utilized them effectively.

1. Reading

Itâ€™s all about strategy. The passages are very long (700+ words, 7â€“8 para) but rarely has fancy words unlike GRE. I assume you are aware abt the structure, (Thereâ€™s one big Reading sectionâ€™s timer running) i.e., 3 passages -> 54mins and incase of 4 passages -> 72mins. Which means you must not take more than 18 mins per passage and be very strict with time management.

Iâ€™ll mention various strategies Iâ€™ve tried and my observations

1. Donâ€™t read anything just start answering: -Â This seemed to work well initially as most of the questions cite the source para (i.e., para number ). But at times, there can be certain terminologies or context that the passage establishes in its initial paras and these are needed to better comprehend a question. So, though I had enough time to tackle each question, I ended up spending much time understanding the question and finding its answer in the cited para as I couldnâ€™t understand what I was reading.
2. Read 1â€“2 sentences of each para and make notes: -Â Clearly, with this approach the previous problem is resolved (context and terminologies) but let me remind you we are timed! If you are not a good at skimming and reading really quick you can easily end up squandering so much time. Following this approach, I just did not have enough time to answer questions that were inference, Rhetoric or summarization based, since I had to go through the respec para again.
3. (WORKED!) Read just for the 1st minute and make notes: -Â This is what worked for me! I read as much as I could in the first minute i.e., read first para and then 1st sentence of every consecutive para. I found that the most imp context is mostly established in the first para and when you read it completely and make notes, you are well equipped for questions. This way, you have understood the concept and still have 17 minutes to tackle questions.

NOTE: - Taking notes helped me when the passage was from a geek field to me!

2. Listening

Thereâ€™s absolutelyÂ no strategyÂ here, just NOTES NOTES NOTES! I was really quick in taking notes, and almost had everything on paper. Itâ€™s just you who need to understand, so use whatever helps!

Lengthy sec has 4 lectures and 3 conversations and shorter one has 3 lecs and 2 convs. lecture â†’ 6 ques and Conversation â†’ 5ques. Each question <= 30secs.

NOTE: - never train yourself to focus in a silent room, choose noise and disturbances (not visual just audio disturbances). BELIEVE ME!! It can get horrible at the center. When I was listening, a boy exactly behind me was shouting (speaking) and other time I could hear other personâ€™s audio (Listening).

3. Speaking

The templates + practice, is what helps you prepare and arrive at your own strategy. Iâ€™ve spent most of my preparation time practicing this section.

[https://youtu.be/Uig0gJDx-7s](https://youtu.be/Uig0gJDx-7s "youtu.be")Â â€” The templates she mentions are really great, just note them down and practice applying these templates. You don't have to stick to these, they help you plan well in very short time.

Also, watch noteful videos on youtube.

4. WritingÂ â€” Itâ€™s better if I donâ€™t write about itðŸ˜›

So, Time for Resources to practice!!!

2. Barrons  
    [BARRONS - TOEFL iBT](https://toefl.learnwithatom.com/index-splash.html "toefl.learnwithatom.com")Â â€” DO NOT use this for Listening section, it doesnâ€™t time the section correctly.
