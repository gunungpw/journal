In this activity, you will create an escalation email. Escalation is the process of enlisting project leadership or management to help remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, or validate next steps. One of your most important responsibilities as a project manager is to help resolve problems and remove barriers for your team. Escalation helps you do that, so you can keep making progress toward your goals. 

Remember that the keys to writing a strong escalation email include:

- Maintain a friendly and blameless tone
    
- State your connection to the project
    
- Explain the problem succinctly
    
- Explain the consequences of the problem
    
- Propose a course of action and make a request 
    

After you complete your email draft, you will compare your work to an exemplar escalation email, and make edits to your own work as needed.

## Scenario

## Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green is testing the Plant Pals project before official launch, and you are the project manager responsible for the project’s success. The team has already begun sending out test shipments to customers.

However, your team has encountered some problems along the way. One major issue is that you don’t have enough drivers to deliver all of the orders on time. So far, the drivers have delivered only 80% of the plants successfully. Customer satisfaction has suffered, and some customers have already canceled their subscriptions. Your team needs to raise the on-time delivery rate to at least 90% to avoid sending the next batch out late. A delay could create even more issues—setting back the project timeline, risking product quality, and hurting revenue.

You have several ideas to improve future delivery rates, but you need to discuss them with senior stakeholders. In order to explain the problem and your recommendations, you write an escalation email to the Director of Operations, the HR Specialist, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, and the Director of Product.

### **Step 2: Write a subject line**

Give your email a subject line that lets your stakeholders know the message is important. Under **Subject**, write, “[Action Required],” followed by a concise description of the problem posed in the scenario.

**Step 3: Write a greeting (keeping a friendly tone)**

Start the email with a friendly greeting. You could thank your audience for their work so far or point out an aspect of the project that’s going particularly well.

_**Note:**_ _Keep in mind that it’s important to address project issues graciously. Try to maintain a blameless tone from the subject line to the closing and always be respectful of your audience’s time and efforts._

**Step 4: State your connection to the project**

Unless you know the recipients well and interact with them often, begin by introducing yourself. Clearly state your name, role, and relationship to the project. Keep your introduction brief and to the point. A single sentence should be enough.

### **Step 5: Explain the problem**

Now it's time to explain the issue. Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve. Give your audience enough detail to understand the issue, but try to be as brief as possible. 

### **Step 6: Explain the consequences of the issue**

Once you’ve explained the problem, identify its consequences. Describe how the issue has affected the project or how it could impact the project later on. Be concise, but specific.

**Step 7: Propose a course of action and make a request**

When escalating a problem, it's a good idea to offer recommendations as well. Think through a few potential solutions and present them to your audience. 

Then clearly state what you need from your recipients. You might request a meeting to discuss recommendations or ask them to take action on a proposed solution.

**Step 8: Close the email (keeping a friendly tone)**

Finally, thank your audience for their time and add a sign off. Don't forget to include your title and contact information in addition to your name.

After you complete your escalation email, you can compare your work to an exemplar. The reading assignment, [Writing an effective escalation email](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-execution-google/supplement/omu3H/writing-an-effective-escalation-email), includes a good example of an email for you to assess, along with an accompanying breakdown. As you review it, it may also help to check your email according to the following questions:   

- Does the email include the following elements: a subject line, greeting, body, and closing?
    
- Does the email maintain a friendly tone? 
    
- Does the email state your connection to the project? 
    
- Does the email explain the problem?  
    
- Does the email explain the consequences? 
    
- Does the email propose at least one action or solution? 
    
- Does the email make a request?
    

**Note:** _The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Your work will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that your finished product helps you learn the process of writing an escalation email._
