With the rise of digital technologies and their growing importance to daily life, the amount of data being generated and collected is growing exponentially. You might have heard of data informed decisions or data driven companies, or even data based advertising. All of these phrases stress the importance of data in common business actions. But as I'm sure you can imagine, the sheer volume of data we have access to can also be a bit overwhelming. So it's a good idea to start with a clear goal and a framework that will help to approach the data. That's what we will focus on in this first week of our Intro to Data Analytics course. First, we'll define what data analytics is and we'll take a closer look at the job of a data analyst. We'll also distinguish data analytics from data science. And next we're going to focus on the OSEMN framework. We'll pronounce this as awesome framework. We will highlight how we will first define the goals for any data analytics project, and then we will discuss how the OSEMN framework can help us approach any data analytics task. By the end of the week, you'll have a concrete understanding of how data analytics projects are structured as well as questions to consider while conducting a project. And hopefully you'll see some of the awesomeness of the framework. So let's get started.
