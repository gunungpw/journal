In the OSEMN framework, the second phase, scrubbing, involves cleaning your data to ensure it is usable for further analysis. This process transforms raw, dirty data into clean, reliable data.

#### Importance of Data Scrubbing
- **Preventing Errors**: Ensures that errors in data do not affect your analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions.
- **Ensuring Usability**: Clean data is essential for effective exploration, modeling, and interpretation.

#### Tasks in the Data Scrubbing Process

1. **Removing Duplicates**
   - **Objective**: Eliminate any repeated records in your dataset.
   - **Reason**: Duplicate records can skew analysis results and lead to inaccurate conclusions.

2. **Formatting Records**
   - **Objective**: Ensure data is consistently formatted.
   - **Reason**: Inconsistencies in data formatting can create problems during analysis and modeling, such as mismatched data types or incompatible records.

3. **Solving for Missing Values**
   - **Objective**: Address any gaps or missing values in your data.
   - **Reason**: Missing data can distort analysis outcomes. You can handle missing values by imputation (filling in gaps with estimated values) or by removing records with missing data, depending on the context and the amount of missing information.

4. **Checking Records for Mistakes or Wrong Values**
   - **Objective**: Identify and correct any inaccuracies or errors in the data.
   - **Reason**: Inaccurate data can mislead analysis and result in faulty conclusions. This includes checking for out-of-range values, typographical errors, and logically inconsistent data points.

#### Clean Data Characteristics
- **Unique Records**: No duplicates.
- **Consistent Structure**: Uniform format throughout the dataset.
- **No Missing Values**: All necessary data points are filled or appropriately handled.
- **Reliable Information**: Accurate and valid data free of errors.

### Conclusion
Taking the time to scrub your data is crucial. Clean data ensures that subsequent analysis, exploration, and modeling processes are accurate and reliable, preventing potential issues that could compromise your results. In the following sections, we'll explore each step of the data scrubbing process in more detail.
