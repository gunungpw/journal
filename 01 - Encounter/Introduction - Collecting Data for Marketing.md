In our previous lesson, you learned about different ways in which data can be collected online. We looked at web server logs, cookies, tags or pixels, SDKs, APIs and we also talked about UIDs.

Each of these methods can help you achieve slightly different things and I think they can be quite confusing. So that's why in this lesson I want to focus on how they are used in practice. To do that, we're going to take a look at another fictitious company, Calla & Ivy. Calla & Ivy is a flower shop in Amsterdam; Imra is the owner of the store. She always loved fresh flowers, but she is particularly known for her handbound bouquets. A few years ago Imra started selling these bouquets online and her business has expanded quite a bit as a result. She now employs a few people who help her focus on the website and they also help her with her marketing. Recently, Imra introduced a flower subscription service. Subscribers can schedule monthly deliveries of bouquets to their home. In the next video, we'll explore how Imra and her team collect and use data to help them market their products. Let's take a look.
