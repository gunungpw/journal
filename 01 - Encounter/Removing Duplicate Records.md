#### Importance of Removing Duplicates
- **Distortion of Analysis**: Duplicates can skew analysis results, leading to inaccurate conclusions.
- **Common Causes**: Human error (e.g., repeated entries, copying errors) and machine error (e.g., malfunction or design flaws).

#### Example of Duplicates
- **Supermarket Checkout**: Self-scanning barcodes may result in duplicates if a barcode is accidentally scanned twice. This can cause discrepancies in stock or inventory counts.

#### Steps to Remove Duplicates
	1. **Identify Duplicate Records**
   - **Manual Inspection**: Checking records one by one.
   - **Automatic Detection**: Using tools like Excel to find duplicates.
   - **Example**: Entries with the same user and purchase ID indicate a duplicate.

2. **Remove Duplicate Entries**
   - **Manual Removal**: Deleting duplicates individually.
   - **Programmatic Removal**: Writing scripts to remove duplicates automatically.

#### Key Considerations
- **Confirming Duplicates**: Ensure repeated records are indeed duplicates and not different entries with missing information (e.g., same names but different middle names).

#### Tools and Techniques
- **Spreadsheets**: Tools like Excel have built-in functions to identify and remove duplicates.
- **Programming**: Learn to write scripts for more complex datasets.

By removing duplicates, you ensure that your dataset is clean and ready for accurate analysis and modeling. In the next video, we'll move on to the subsequent task in the data scrubbing phase.
