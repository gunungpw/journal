## What Are Models and Why Use Them?

You might not know it, but we live in a world full of models. In marketing, for instance, models are used for a number of different tasks, including projecting sales, predicting whether an individual is likely to buy a product, splitting audiences into subgroups, and finding new potential customers. In fact, it's hard to find an area where models aren't used. You'll hear about economic predictions and weather forecasts if you listen to the news. If you go on your favorite social media apps, your feed is full of content that you might like, and you're shown advertisements based on the groups you are perceived to be in. These are all examples of models.

### What Are Models?

Models are mathematical tools that can be used to recognize hidden patterns in data that often aren't obvious to humans. Models can be used to try and apply those patterns to different data. Their most common use is making predictions about the future based on data from the past. Creating some models can be really simple. For instance, calculating the average of a set of data and then predicting our future data will be average is a simple model. It's often not a very good one, but it is a model. 

Creating models can also be very complex, like machine learning models that try and predict stock prices, or models that generate amazing text and images. The good news is that you often don't need to know how to build them to use them! Analysts will often work very closely with a team of data scientists or with a specialized firm that builds the models for them. So, we'll focus on understanding how to use them, so that you can pick the right model for the job and use it correctly in your work as a data analyst.

### Why Use Models?

Models are powerful because they enable us to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. Here are some key reasons why models are essential:

1. **Prediction**: Models help predict future outcomes based on historical data. For example, you can predict sales, customer behavior, or market trends.
2. **Understanding Relationships**: Models can uncover relationships between variables that are not immediately obvious. This can help identify factors that influence outcomes.
3. **Optimization**: By understanding these relationships, businesses can optimize processes, such as marketing campaigns, inventory management, and resource allocation.
4. **Automation**: Models can automate decision-making processes, reducing the need for human intervention and increasing efficiency.

### Example: Linear Regression

Let's look at a type of model you'll learn to use called a **Linear Regression**. Linear regression sounds fancy, but it just means a line that can be used to predict the value of one variable using the value of another variable.

#### Linear Regression Example

This particular linear regression predicts the price of a house based on the square footage. The line and shaded region represent our model and its predictions, while the dots are the examples the model examined from the data set we trained it on. In other words, the dots represent the data we gave to the machine to learn more about house prices, and the machine then used that learning to make predictions about other prices.

This model gives price predictions for a given amount of square footage. For instance, to get the prediction for a 3000-square-foot house, we find the x-coordinate (Square feet) and move up until we hit that prediction line. Then we take the Y coordinate on the line as the corresponding prediction! We can see that the model predicts that the higher the square footage, the higher the price of the house-- this makes sense.

Remember that I mentioned predictions will not be perfectly accurate. This is what the shaded area represents-- the margin of error with 95% confidence, meaning that we're 95% sure that the actual value will land somewhere in the shaded area. The ability to quantify uncertainty like this is what allows us to make smart business decisions about the predictions our models make and how much we should trust a given prediction.

### The Value of Uncertainty

As the statistician George Box famously said, "All models are wrong, but some are useful." We must understand that the predictions our models make won't be perfectly accurate. However, with the right data, they'll be accurate enough to generate insights that have business value. The predictions that models make are never 100% certain, but importantly, we can quantify the uncertainty for each model. This allows us to understand how far off the average prediction might be.

### Recap

To recap, models are essential tools in data analysis for making predictions and uncovering hidden patterns in data. They range from simple averages to complex machine learning algorithms. As a data analyst, understanding how to use models correctly can help you make informed decisions, optimize processes, and ultimately drive business value. Remember, while models are not perfect, they can provide valuable insights that guide your decision-making process.
