That brings us to the end of another week in this course, congratulations. We've now covered two of the five steps in the OSEMN framework, and you're well on your way to becoming a data analyst. You now know how to obtain data for analytics projects and how to check its validity. You also know which steps you should take to scrub your data to get it ready for further analysis. And you've seen the obtain and scrub phase applied to an example following Kira and Carlos at Inu and Neko in their data project to help get their e-commerce business off to a good start. Now, we'll move on to the next steps, exploring and modeling the data. See you there.
