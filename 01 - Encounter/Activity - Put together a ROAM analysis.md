# Activity - Put together a ROAM analysis

Question 1

To pass this practice quiz, you must receive at least 80%, or 4 out of 5 points, by completing the activity and answering corresponding quiz questions. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the [Course Overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-execution-google/supplement/CUMrZ/course-4-overview).

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will apply risk management skills to identify risks and put together a ROAM analysis. You can use a ROAM analysis to analyze, prioritize, and manage risks that have already become issues. It's a great tool to keep teams organized, so they know what needs to be done to keep the project moving forward.

In a ROAM analysis, you identify project issues and put them into one of the following four categories:

- **Resolved**: The issue has been eliminated and no longer poses a problem.
    
- **Owned**: The issue has been assigned to a team member who will monitor it through to completion.
    
- **Accepted**: The issue is minor or cannot be resolved, so the team chooses to accept and work around it.
    
- **Mitigated**: The team has taken action to reduce the impact of the issue (or reduce the likelihood of a risk that has not yet materialized).
    

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

After installing the new software to keep track of orders and shipments, Plant Pals began sending out the first test batch of plants to customers. Your team has been conducting an ongoing customer satisfaction survey. Two weeks into the test shipments, the survey reveals the following issues:

- The warehouse team reports that 10% of the plants were not properly potted. This leads to customer complaints, profit loss, and budget issues you did not anticipate.
    
- Due to a software issue, the customer relations team is receiving only 30% of requests and complaints. This leads to customer dissatisfaction.
    
- There are not enough delivery drivers to deliver all the Plant Pals orders on time. The current delivery completion rate is 80%, leading some customers to cancel their subscriptions.

## Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed ROAM analysis. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

Let’s review each issue in the ROAM analysis:

**Issue 1:** In response to the potting issue, you contacted the warehouse to evaluate and improve the potting process. After two weeks with no additional problems, you consider the matter **resolved**. 

**Issue 2:** Your team handled the customer complaints by listening to their issues and offering to send them free plants. Most of the customers were satisfied with this solution. This issue is **mitigated** because you reduced its impact. 

**Issue 3:** You assign your IT Specialist to fix the issue with the customer service software. This issue is **owned** because the IT Specialist has not yet taken action, but there is a plan in place to take care of the issue.

**Issue 4:** Some customers have called to cancel their subscriptions. Your team offered them subscription promotions, but cannot get them to reconsider. Since a few cancellations will not have a major impact, you consider this issue **accepted**.

**Issue 5:** To solve the delivery driver problem, you ask the HR Specialist to schedule a hiring day to hire and onboard more drivers. This issue is **owned** by the HR Specialist because they have not yet hired the drivers.

**Issue 6:** Your team reassessed delivery routes, which increased efficiency and reduced the number of late deliveries. This risk is **mitigated** because you have lessened its impact.

**Issue 7:** Your Financial Analyst reassessed spending and found more money to offset the unexpected costs, so the issue is **resolved**.
