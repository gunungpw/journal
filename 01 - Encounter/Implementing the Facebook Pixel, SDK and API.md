# Implementing Data Collection Tools

In previous lessons, we’ve learned about the many different types of data that can be collected, from the different websites people visit to the ads they see along the way. Just like there are many different data points, there are various ways to collect data, each with their own features and purposes. Although much of the information these tools collect and organize for you can be found on the web server logs for your site, that’s not always easy or practical. In this reading, we’ll take a look at three tools that will help you collect data. 

# Facebook Pixel 

Pixels, also referred to as tags, are used for tracking, measurement and advertising. As mentioned in the introduction section above, it’s not always easy or practical to look at data from your web server logs or even cookies. Luckily you can work with companies to help you track user behavior or advertise products. A pixel is a small piece of code that you can add to your website that  instructs it to send some information to an identified third party, in other words, these companies looking to help you utilize your data. The Facebook pixel is one example. Here, the information is used to help connect advertising on Facebook with actions taken on the site, allowing you to check how effective your advertising on Facebook was. 

# SDKs

An SDK, or software development kit, is a library of pieces of code that you can integrate into your app to add certain functions. Where on a website you can use a pixel or tag, you would use an SDK for your app. The SDK sends the information about people’s interaction with the app to, for example, Google Analytics where both website and app information can be aggregated. A great example of an SDK that you might see every day is an app that asks you to sign in with your Google or Facebook account. For your website, you might use an SDK to create a smooth checkout experience for customers, as well as, of course, tracking various data points of your browsers’ activity. If users have signed into your app using their Facebook account, for instance, you can also see whether an ad they saw on Facebook inspired them to download your app and make in-app purchases. 

# APIs

An API, or an application programming interface, is a tool that establishes a connection between two pieces of software. Remember the example of sharing a news article on Twitter from the previous lesson? In the same way APIs make it possible to share your article, they make it possible to share data directly with certain marketing or advertising platforms. This is useful because you can then use these connections to learn more about the results of your marketing activities. For example, you can send purchase data to Facebook, which can then help you figure out whether the ads you placed on their platform lead to the purchases. 

# Implementing the tools

### How to do it

Using these tools is often as easy as integrating them into your website’s already existing code. Most of these tools, for example the Facebook pixel and the Google Ads Remarketing, have the code readily available in the help documentation or other information for web developers. This allows you or your content developers to install the code easily so you can start tracking.

### Why they’re useful

Implementing tools such as these can allow you to encourage browsers of your website and app to purchase, subscribe and more. The Facebook pixel, for example, can also create custom target audiences consisting of people who have engaged with the website and who you would like to target with more specific advertising messages. 

These tools also allow you to integrate your website experience with that of your app. For example, you can use an SDK to instruct your app to send certain information over to the platform that created the SDK, and that data can then be connected to other actions marketers take using the platform, like advertising.
