We've talked about the different types of data marketers and marketing analysts work with, and how these days, a lot of data is related to the use of digital media. We get data about different websites people visit, the way they navigate on websites, the products they purchase online, apps they download, ads they see, and so on. In order to get the most out of the data that's available to you as a marketer, it's important to understand how this data is collected. That's what we will cover in this lesson. First, we'll go over how online interactions generate data. Then, we'll take a look at data collection on websites using cookies. We will also look at the use of tags or pixels. Then, we'll take a closer look at the use of software developer kits or SDKs for data collection for mobile apps. We'll also discuss the use of Platform APIs to help connect data that a company may already have to the advertising platforms they may want to use. Finally, we will look at the use of UIDs. Let's get started.
