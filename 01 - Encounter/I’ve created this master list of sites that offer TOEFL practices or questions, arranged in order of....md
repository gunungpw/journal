Table Of Contents Introduction to the TOEFL Test If you're already familiar with the TOEFL exam, then feel free to skip this section :) The TOEFL iBT test is a computer based test. It confirms that a student has the English language skills necessary to succeed in an academic setting. That’s why it is the most highly regarded and widely accepted test in the world. More than 8,500 colleges, universities, and agencies in 130 countries accept TOEFL scores, so test takers have the flexibility to use their TOEFL test scores worldwide. The TOEFL iBT test has four sections: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. Here is a breakdown of each section. Test Section Number of questions Timing Reading 2 passages 10 questions each 36 minutes Listening 3-4 lectures, 6 questions each 2-3 conversations, 5 questions each 41-57 minutes BREAK 10 minutes Speaking 4 tasks: 1 independent and 3 integrated 17 minutes Writing 1 integrated task 1 academic discussion task 20 minutes 10 minutes Let's have a brief look at each TOEFL section. We'll go over what each section includes and where you can find additional resources for each section. TOEFL Reading Test Section The reading section is the first section of the TOEFL iBT test. It tests your ability to read and answer questions about passages. It contain 3-4 passages, and each passage is followed by 12-14 questions for a total of 36-56 questions. Each passage is generally from 600 to 700 words long. You have 60-80 minutes in which to finish this section. What's different about the reading test compared to the other TOEFL test sections is you can skip answers and come back to them later. Once you get to the end of the reading questions, go back and review your answers, but if you're unsure stick with your first choice, it's more than often correct.

II. Practice Tests without a Testing Interface (website, PDF, etc.)

8. TST Prep. It offers 1 free practice test, though it’s numbered “Test #13.” Perhaps there are at least 12 more tests somewhere? (TST has a lot of very useful articles, by the way) The test is in PDF, so it doesn’t mimic the real test, unfortunately.

I am an student at the University of Navarra, and I am currently studying a double degree of History and International Relations. I took the Toefl test because I want to study abroad next semester, and I needed a score over 90 to be able to go to my chosen university. TestDEN helped me a lot with its sample tests, I could practice enough to achieve the grade I needed. I am very happy that I found this website! Raul in Spain Thanks for choosing me. I'm a photographer and cinematographer. I took the test because the US government requires a minimum level of english and I needed an 85 out of 120. I used your website to practice for the test and in the end the test went great. It's a well designed test where I felt comfortable throughout and I ended up getting a 102, so I was very happy. Ayane in Japan Thanks for choosing me for the winner! I am a university student. I've taken the TOEFL exam only once in my life. Since TOEFL is used for the certification of applying to foreign schools, the contents of this exam is more focused on academic English so students who study for TOEFL can get the Engish ability which they can use in their everyday life.

Free TOEFL IBT Practice Test

This site requires JavaScript. To fully use this site, please enable it in your browser. This TOEFL Practice Test is here to help you prepare for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Test administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS). The TOEFL began development in 1962 and was first administered two years later. Its purpose is to prepare international students for studying in an English-speaking country or program. Our Practice TOEFL is here to give you a simulation of the content and is a great primer whether you take the paper-based (PBT) or Internet-based test (iBT). Each testing type is broken up into four sections. For the iBT, you will answer a number of questions in Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing. For the PBT, you will do Listening, Structure and Written Expression, Reading Comprehension and Writing. The iBT is longer, clocking in at around 200 to 250 minutes (including one 10-minute break). The PBT is much shorter running 140 to 150 minutes in overall length. The TOEFL Test is now predominately an iBT, though the paper-based may still be available in some areas. For our purposes moving forward, we will draw from the iBT. TOEFL Test: Reading, 60 to 80 minutes The TOEFL as it appears on test day will run anywhere from 60 to 80 minutes in length. It will consist of four to six passages that you will need to read, each one being around 700 words long. Don't expect any light reading here. Most topics are from academia, and it will be your job to understand rhetorical functions like argumentation, cause-and-effect and compare-and-contrast. You will need to identify specific ideas, themes, inferences, essential information, vocabulary, sentence insertion and more. The test may mandate that you fill out tables complete summaries. Fortunately, you do not need to come into the TOEFL with a prior understanding of the topic at hand in order to get the right answer. TOEFL: Listening, 60 to 90 minutes The Listening section also features a flexible time range with around six to nine passages per test. Each section is three to five minutes in length. The passages typically include conversations between two students, academic lectures or discussions. Conversations may be between the student and a campus employee -- professorial or service-based. As with the Reading section, the lectures will focus on something to do with academia, but the test-taker does not need a prior knowledge of the material in order to get the right answer. That said, it can be quite challenging because you only get one crack at hearing and understanding what the participants in both the conversations and the lectures have to say. You can and should take notes while listening because you will have the opportunity to look over those as you answer each question. Questions are designed to measure your understanding of main ideas, implications, relationships between ideas, important details, speaker purpose, organization of information and speaker attitude. T
