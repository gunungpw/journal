Welcome to the second week of our intro to data analytics scores. Last week, we took a closer look at data analytics and introduced the awesome model. This week we will focus on the first two steps in the awesome model obtaining and scrubbing data. When you start a data analytics project, you might be given some data to work with. But sometimes you just want to prove a hypothesis or an assumption or an expectation. In a case like that, getting started can be a bit overwhelming. You'll soon find that there are lots of data sources out there, often free for you to use. Knowing which ones to focus on and how to clean the data you extract from them is key. This week, you'll learn how to do that. In this first lesson, we'll take a closer look at where data analysts obtain data and what sources are available to you. Then in the second lesson, we will focus on how to clean or scrub the data you obtain so it's ready for your analysis. Then in the final lesson of the week, we will look at an example that illustrates these first two steps in the awesome model, obtaining and scrubbing data. Here's where we dive into the exciting world of data. Let's get started.
