As you continue to learn about data, you will come across tons of data-related terminology. Among these are two often-confused terms: data analysts and data scientists. These two roles are similar in the sense that they both work with data to gather insights, but _how_ they work with data is what sets them apart. In this reading, you will learn the differences between these two disciplines by reviewing their roles, responsibilities, skills, and backgrounds. 

# Data Analysts 

Data analysts work with structured data to identify patterns, build visualizations, and extract meaningful insights that help organizations make informed decisions.  

### Responsibilities

Data analysts are typically responsible for maintaining databases, interpreting data sets, and creating reports that effectively present data trends, patterns, and predictions. Some common tasks include gathering data from various sources, cleaning and organizing data, and presenting findings in easy-to-understand visualizations.

### Skills and Tools

- Foundational mathematics and statistics 
    
- Analytical thinking and data visualization
    
- Basic fluency in R, Python, and SQL 
    
- SAS, Excel, and business intelligence software
    

### Background 

Data analysts are commonly experienced in mathematics and statistics. They might also have a degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or finance. 

# Data Scientists

Data scientists work with various data types, including structured and unstructured data. They use advanced data techniques, including machine learning and predictive modeling, to design processes, develop models, and extract insights from data. 

### Responsibilities

Data scientists are typically responsible for arranging undefined datasets, writing algorithms, building automation systems, and statistical models. Some of their common tasks include gathering and cleaning raw data, creating data visualization tools, dashboards, and reports, and developing code to automate data collection and processing. 

### Skills and Tools

- Advanced statistics and predictive analytics
    
- Machine learning and data modeling
    
- High-level, object-oriented programming
    
- Hadoop, MySQL, TensorFlow, and Spark
    

### Background 

Data scientists are commonly experienced in computer science and are generally required to have a master’s or doctoral degree in data science, information technology, mathematics, or statistics. 

Although their titles are similar, data analysts and data scientists have distinct roles, requirements, and career paths. Now that you know the difference between the two, consider this as you continue your journey in data analysis. 

# Conclusion

Although these two disciplines are very similar and often go hand-in-hand in terms of skills and how they work with data, there are some subtle differences to keep in mind as you explore which focus you’d like to pursue in how you work with data.
