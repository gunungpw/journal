# Activity Introduction

This week you’ve been learning about exploring and modeling data. This exercise is the second of three activities that will be combined at the end of the course to create a cohesive exhibition of your work. 

We have provided you with a Course Exercise Templates Document for you to complete these activities. If you haven’t already, you can download a copy of this Course Exercise Templates document in Step 1 of the Activity Instructions below.

Exploring and Modeling data are the third and fourth steps in the OSEMN process. At this point in the process, you’re able to really gain understanding from the data. Your skills as a data analyst will lead to usable findings in the data. The Exploring and Modeling stages also help you make plans for the future and reach the goals you set at the beginning of the project.

For this second project exercise, you will continue with the provided scenario regarding Anna from BrightThreads. You will review a dataset, a few simple charts, and finally some forward-looking models. You will answer questions that will test your understanding of the Explore and Model stages of the OSEMN process. You will then put all of your answers into the Course Exercise Templates Document.

### **Step 2: Access the activity dataset**

There are two options to access the dataset for this activity:

- If you have a Google account, access [the activity dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOJDKQL1PfQP1Y3-D2kE9eC-Ll3w3JghQEOhl_RQMRg/template/preview) and click Use Template in the upper right corner. 
    
- If you do not have a Google account, download an [Excel version of the Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOJDKQL1PfQP1Y3-D2kE9eC-Ll3w3JghQEOhl_RQMRg/export?format=xlsx).
    

### **Step 3: Review the scenario**

Anna owns a clothing boutique in New York, called BrightThreads. She sells a mix of clothing brands and chooses items for her store that she believes her clients will like. She also sells online. 

### **Step 4: Answer the questions related to the Explore stage of the OSEMN process**

Use the data provided in Step 2 and the template to answer the following questions:

- What are some things you can tell about this dataset? For instance, what does the size of the dataset tell you?  
    
- What kind of data is in this dataset? (Numerical, categorical, etc.)   
    
- Reviewing this data, what is the minimum value in the order_total column? What is the maximum value in order_total column?  
    
- What chart would you use to help visualize this data?  
    
- Based on what you have learned, would you add an additional column to this dataset using feature engineering? For instance, using the sales dates, would it be helpful to add in the day of the week data?  
    

After reviewing the included charts, answer the following questions in the template:

- Based on the data in this chart, what would be a good title for this chart?  
    
- What does this chart tell you about the number of orders in relation to the amount someone spends in their order?   
    
- What range do most of the orders tend to be in?  
    
- Do you notice any correlations between the variables in this chart? If so, how would you describe them?  
    

### **Step 5: Answer the questions related to the Model stage of the OSEMN process**

Use the charts and models included in the template to answer the following questions:

- Reviewing this linear regression model, roughly how many sales can be expected if the marketing budget is increased to $250?  
    
- Review these two linear regression models. The first shows the data that the model trained with and second is a test set. Do you think the model is generalizable for this data? Why or why not?  
    
- Review this clustering model. A clustering algorithm has been used and identified two groups, what might you call the second group? Why?  
    
- You are trying to forecast BrightThreads’ sales in the coming quarter. What model might you use? Why did you choose this?  
    

### **Step 6: Save your work**

Save your work in the Course Exercise Templates Document.
