### Explore what information you’re sharing with Facebook, your friends, and advertisers by using the Privacy Checkup tool or checking your current settings.

In January 2020, Facebook rolled out a new version of the Privacy Checkup tool.  This new version provides you more privacy options. You can access it from your home screen in the app or by [clicking here](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/checkup/?source=privacy_basics_site). Helpful guides in Privacy Checkup walk you through settings attached to your account. They tell you about the private information Facebook currently manages. The topics covered in the Privacy Checkup are:

- Who can see what you share
    
- How to keep your account secure
    
- How people can find you
    
- Your data settings on Facebook
    
- Your ad preferences on Facebook
