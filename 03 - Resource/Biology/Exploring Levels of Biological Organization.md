# Exploring Levels of Biological Organization

## The Biosphere

Even from space, we can see signs of Earth’s life—in the mosaic of greens indicating forests, for example. We can also see the biosphere, which consists of all life on Earth and all the places where life exists: most regions of land, most bodies of water, the atmosphere to an altitude of several kilometers, and even sediments far below the ocean floor.

## Ecosystem

Our first scale change brings us to a North American mountain meadow, which is an example of an ecosystem, as are a tropical forest, grassland, desert, and coral reef. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area, along with all the nonliving components of the environment with which life interacts, such as soil, water, atmospheric gases, and light. 

## Communities

The array of organisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem is called a biological community. The community in our meadow ecosystem includes many kinds of plants, various animals, mushrooms and other fungi, and enormous numbers of diverse microorganisms, such as bacteria, that are too small to see without a microscope. Each of these forms of life belongs to a species—a group whose members can only reproduce with other members of the group.

## Population

A population consists of all the individuals of a species living within the bounds of a specified area that interbreed with each other. For example, our meadow includes a population of lupines (some of which are shown here) and a population of mule deer. A community is therefore the set of populations that inhabit a particular area.

## Organisms

Individual living things are called organisms. Each plant in the meadow is an organism, and so is each animal, fungus, and bacterium.
