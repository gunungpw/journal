# Plant

Plants, like most animals, are composed of cells, tissues, and organs. A cell is the fundamental unit of life. A tissue is a group of cells consisting of one or more cell types that together perform a specialized function. An organ consists of several types of tissues that together carry out particular funtions. As you learn about plant structure, keep in mind how natural selection has produced plant forms that fit plant function at all levels of structure. We begin by discussing plant organs because their structures are most familiar.

Vascular Plant Organs:

## Roots, Stems, and Leaves

EVOLUTION The basic morphology, or shape, of vascular plants reflects their evolutionary history as terrestrial organ- isms that inhabit and draw resources from two very different environments—below the ground and above the ground. They must absorb water and minerals from below the ground surface and $CO_2$ and light from above the ground surface. The ability to acquire these resources efficiently is traceable to the evolution of roots, stems, and leaves as the three basic organs. These organs form a root system and a shoot system, the latter consisting of stems and leaves. Vascular plants, with few exceptions, rely on both systems for survival. Roots are almost never photosynthetic; they starve unless photosynthates, the sugars and the other carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis, are imported from the shoot system. Conversely, the shoot system depends on the water and minerals that roots absorb from the soil.

### Roots

A root is an organ that anchors a vascular plant in the soil, absorbs minerals and water, and often stores carbohydrates and other reserves. The primary root, originating in the seed embryo, is the first root (and the first organ) to emerge from a germinating seed. It soon branches to form lateral roots that can also branch, greatly enhancing the ability of the root system to anchor the plant and to acquire resources such as water and minerals from the soil.

Tall, erect plants with large shoot masses generally have a taproot system, consisting of one main vertical root, the taproot, which usually develops from the primary root. In taproot systems, the role of absorption is restricted largely to the tips of lateral roots. A taproot, although energetically expensive to make, facilitates the anchorage of the plant in the soil. By preventing toppling, the taproot enables the plant to grow taller, thereby giving it access to more favorable light conditions and, in some cases, providing an advantage for pollen and seed dispersal. Taproots can also be specialized for food storage.

Small vascular plants or those that have a trailing growth habit are particularly susceptible to grazing animals that can uproot the plant and kill it. Such plants are most efficiently anchored by a fibrous root system, a thick mat of slender roots spreading out below the soil surface. In plants that have fibrous root systems, including most monocots, the primary root dies early on and does not form a taproot. Instead, many small roots emerge from the stem. Such roots are said to be adventitious, a term describing a plant organ that grows in an unusual location, such as roots arising from stems or leaves. Each root forms its own lateral roots, which in turn form their own lateral roots. Because this mat of roots holds the topsoil in place, plants such as grasses that have dense fibrous root systems are especially good at preventing soil erosion.

In most plants, the absorption of water and minerals occurs primarily near the tips of elongating roots, where vast numbers of root hairs, thin, finger-like extensions of root epidermal cells, emerge and increase the surface area of the root enormously. Most root systems also form mycorrhizal associations, symbiotic interactions with soil fungi that increase a plant’s ability to absorb minerals. The roots of many plants are adapted for specialized functions.

### Stems

A stem is a plant organ bearing leaves and buds. Its chief function is to elongate and orient the shoot in a way that maximizes photosynthesis by the leaves. Another function of stems is to elevate reproductive structures, thereby facilitating the dispersal of pollen and fruit. Green stems may also per- form a limited amount of photosynthesis. Each stem consists of an alternating system of nodes, the points at which leaves are attached, and internodes, the stem segments between nodes. Most of the growth of a young shoot is concentrated near the growing shoot tip, or apical bud. Apical buds are not the only types of buds found in shoots. In the upper angle (axil) formed by each leaf and the stem is an axillary bud, which can potentially form a lateral branch or, in some cases, a thorn or flower. Some plants have stems with alternative functions, such as food storage or asexual reproduction. Many of these modified stems, including rhizomes, stolons, and tubers, are often mis- taken for roots.

### Leaves

In most vascular plants, the leaf is the main photosynthetic organ. In addition to intercepting light, leaves exchange gases with the atmosphere, dissipate heat, and defend themselves from herbivores and pathogens. These functions may have conflicting anatomical and physiological requirements. For example, a dense covering of hairs may help repel herbivorous insects but may also trap air near the leaf surface, thereby reducing gas exchange and, consequently, photosynthesis. Because of these conflicting demands and tradeoffs, leaves vary extensively in form. In general, however, a leaf consists of a flattened blade and a stalk, the petiole, which joins the leaf to the stem at a node. Grasses and many other monocots lack petioles; instead, the base of the leaf forms a sheath that envelops the stem.

Monocots and eudicots differ in the arrangement of veins, the vascular tissue of leaves. Most monocots have parallel major veins of equal diameter that run the length of the blade. Eudicots generally have a branched network of veins arising from a major vein (the midrib) that runs down the center of the blade.

In identifying angiosperms according to structure, taxonomists rely mainly on floral morphology, but they also use variations in leaf morphology, such as leaf shape, the branching pattern of veins, and the spatial arrangement of leaves. Figure 35.6 illustrates a difference in leaf shape: simple versus compound. Unlike leaves, the leaflets of compound leaves are not associated with axillary buds. Compound leaves may help confine invading pathogens to a single leaflet, rather than allowing them to spread to the entire leaf.

The shapes of leaves are often products of genetic programs that are tweaked by environmental influences. Interpret the data in the Scientific Skills Exercise to explore the roles of genetics and the environment in determining leaf morphology in red maple trees.

Almost all leaves are specialized for photosynthesis. However, in some species evolution has resulted in additional functions, such as support, protection, storage, or asexual reproduction. Some are sporophylls, leaves highly specialized for sexual reproduction, such as carpels and stamens in flowers.
