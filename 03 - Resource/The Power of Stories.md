# The Power of Stories

We can tell stories as a way to entertain, like when we read a mystery novel or go to a movie. But much more than to entertain, we can use stories as a way to teach and share knowledge. Even our novels and movies teaches things. They often inspire us to want to do better in our lives, and they warn us of things like the dangers of war. In this lesson, we'll explore how to use the power of storytelling to make sense of our data and create compelling stories from it. Picture yourself as a master storyteller. As a storyteller, your words create characters, plot twists and intense climaxes. Well, as a data analyst, you're also a storyteller, Adidas storyteller, and you're using data, visuals and a narrative to set up and build your story so that you can inform and persuade your audience. The narrative you create explains the origin of your data and its purpose. It provides a context to your findings and links the data to the answers we need. Using visuals as an aid, your story helps to bring the insights to life and presents a comprehensive picture in a way that's easy for everyone to grasp. Later in this lesson, we'll further explore how to build a narrative from your data and use visuals to craft a compelling and persuasive story for your audience. Let's get started.
