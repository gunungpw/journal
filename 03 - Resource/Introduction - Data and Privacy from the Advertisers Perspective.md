We're continuing to explore personal data and privacy. In the previous lesson, we started with the consumer perspective, we took a look at what data consumers frequently provide and how they can take ownership of this information. Now we'll take a look at the advertiser side of the equation and what advertisers need to keep in mind when working with data consumers have shared. First we'll look at what it means to be a responsible advertiser. Then we'll explore the advertising ecosystem and all the different parties that will touch user data and carry some responsibility. And finally, we'll talk a bit more about who owns and manages the data. I'm excited to get started so see you in the next video.
