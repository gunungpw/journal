# Activity: iNterpreting Data

# Activity Introduction

This week you’ve been learning about interpreting data. This exercise is the last of three activities that will be combined at the end of the course to create a cohesive exhibition of your work.

We have provided you with a Course Exercise Templates Document for you to complete these activities. If you haven’t already, you can download a copy of this Course Exercise Templates document in Step 1 of the Activity Instructions below.

Interpreting data is critically important in data analysis. You can obtain, scrub, explore, and model data extremely well, but it could have little to no impact on an organization if it isn’t interpreted and communicated successfully. The final step in the OSEMN process will always involve determining the best way to share with others what you have learned from your analysis. 

For this final project exercise, you will review a presentation that has been assembled by Anna from BrightThreads. You will review the scenario and presentation and then provide your thoughts. You will then put all of your answers into the Course Exercise Templates Document.
