## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a project budget to estimate the total cost for developing and implementing an Operations and Training Plan. Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar so you can compare your work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

## Scenario

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hVmbXqU4TfaZm16lOP323g_e4c571928fbb4117a547fc86e8c5a886_line-y.png?expiry=1715472000000&hmac=QgenFRd-8S_E2fH0ntGk4ffovZLyIhzFdA_0wsJ65hc)

Review the scenario below. Then follow the step-by-step instructions.

As project manager for Office Green, your job includes working with the operations team to develop and implement an Operations and Training plan for the Plant Pals service. In addition to identifying the major milestones and associated tasks for this plan, you also need to estimate the costs and create a budget.

You will use this budget as a baseline throughout the project, but you should monitor spending throughout the project and make adjustments as needed.

The estimated costs of the milestones and their subtasks are as follows:

**Milestone 1**: **Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan.**

- _Task 1:_ Purchase delivery trucks. Purchase two delivery trucks at a cost of $15,000 per truck.
    
- _Task 2:_ Source packaging materials. Purchase 1,500 boxes at a cost of $2 per box. 
    
- _Task 3:_ Pay delivery drivers. Pay two delivery drivers for ten days (assume eight-hour work days) at a rate of $15 per hour.
    

**Milestone 2: Select and install supply chain management software and equipment.**

- _Task 1:_ Source vendor (includes setup, installation, and deployment of software and equipment systems): Fixed cost of $15,000.
    

**Milestone 3: Develop and launch an employee training program.**

- _Task 1:_ Develop training sessions. Pay the HR specialist $50 per hour for ten days (assume eight-hour workdays).
    
- _Task 2:_ Train employees to use the software and equipment. Pay the Training Manager $25 per hour for ten days (assume eight-hour workdays).
    
- _Task 3:_ Monitor employee progress and improve training processes. Pay the Training Manager $25 per hour for another ten days (assume eight-hour workdays).
    

Your estimated budget to reach these milestones is $62,000. This amount includes a reserve buffer of $3,600 to account for unexpected costs. You should generally allow for a buffer of at least 5%.

**Step 2: Add milestones and tasks**

Fill in the project milestones and tasks under **Milestones & Tasks**. Be sure to group each task with its associated milestone. When you’re finished, your budget should include three milestones and seven tasks. We’ve filled in the first milestone and task for you.

**Step 3: List project employees**

For each task associated with particular employees, enter the employee who should be paid for that task under **Employee Details**. Some tasks may not have any associated employees, while others could have two or more (e.g., two delivery drivers).

_**Note:**_ _Your spreadsheet should include the pay rates for hourly employees, like the delivery drivers. You should only list salaried employees when they work extra hours on special projects included in the scenario (e.g., the HR Specialist developing the training sessions)._

**Step 4: List employee hours and rates**

Next, calculate the number of hours each employee will spend on each task. Enter this number under **Hours**. Now list each employee’s hourly pay rate under **Rate**. Note that the spreadsheet calculates the total cost for you.

**Step 5: Enter material quantities and costs**

Now review the scenario for any materials you need to purchase (e.g., trucks, boxes):

- For materials priced per unit, enter the amount needed under **Units**. Then record the cost per unit under **$/Unit**. 
    
- For fixed-cost materials, record the price under **Fixed Cost**.
    

### Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the project budget template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

Compare the exemplar to your completed budget. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Let’s review each section of the budget:

- The exemplar includes all three milestones and the seven associated tasks.
    
- Each task includes the relevant information from the scenario (employee details, cost of labor or materials, or a fixed fee).
    
- The completed spreadsheet breaks down the budget by milestone. The total budget, including a $3,600 buffer, comes to $62,000.
