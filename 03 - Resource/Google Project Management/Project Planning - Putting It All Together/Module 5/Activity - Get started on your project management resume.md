**Step 2: Find a job description that interests you**

For this activity, you will need to refer to the [_Tailoring your resume for project management_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/supplement/1M2nH/tailoring-a-resume-for-project-management) reading. Keep it open as you fill out the sections of your resume.

Before creating your resume, think about the kind of position you want. Project management skills are used in nearly every industry, so spend some time thinking about where you want to apply your skills. 

Next, find a job description that interests you. Review it carefully and highlight some of the qualities the employer is searching for. For example, “detail-oriented,” “collaborative,” “strategic,” and “creative” are all qualities that could appear in job descriptions. Be sure to use some of these keywords in your resume so the company understands how you can meet their needs. 

Review the **Tailor the content** section of the reading for more information on how to connect your experience to the job description.

**Step 3: Create your project management resume**

Now that you’re familiar with the job description, it’s time to start writing your resume. Refer to the reading for detailed instructions on how to fill out the following sections of the template:

- Contact information
    
- Professional summary
    
- Core competencies 
    
- Professional experience
    
- Education and certifications
    

**Step 4: Proofread and format your resume**

Finally, proofread your resume for spelling and grammatical errors. You can adjust the template as needed, but make sure it’s easy to read. Websites like [resumeworded.com](https://resumeworded.com/) or [enhancv.com](https://enhancv.com/) can help you find a template style that works for you.

## Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed resume. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Let’s review each of the resume elements:

**Contact information**: The resume includes your name, location, phone number, and links to your email address, professional social media account, and website (if you have one).

**Professional summary**: A short summary of one to three sentences that clearly states why you are the best candidate for the position. It should highlight the most important things you want the reader to know about you.

**Core competencies**: A bulleted list of the most relevant skills related to the position you’re applying to. For example, Sophie helped run events at a bookstore and communicated that as “event planning and oversight.”

**Professional experience**: A list of at least three of your past positions in reverse chronological order and descriptions of your responsibilities and accomplishments. They should be tailored to the job description and highlight concrete results using the P.A.R.I.S. framework. For example, Sophie coordinated events at the bookstore and wrote, “Coordinated weekly readings and other events, including author communication, marketing and social media, stock ordering, event setup and breakdown; events increased average revenue by ~27% on event days.”

**Education and certifications**: Any degrees you hold and the Google Project Management Certificate.

**Format and clarity**: The formatting is clear and consistent and the resume is easy to read.
