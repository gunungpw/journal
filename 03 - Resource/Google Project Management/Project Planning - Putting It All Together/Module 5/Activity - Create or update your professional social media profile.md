This is an optional activity. To "pass" this practice quiz, you must receive 100%, or 1 out of 1 point, by completing the activity below.

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create or update a professional social media profile (LinkedIn) to prepare you for your job search. Prospective employers will check out your online presence, so your professional profile is as important as your resume. This profile should highlight the same project management experience and skills as your resume, with a few key differences. As you move through the program and learn more about project management, you should update this profile to include your new skills and experience

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

### Part 1 - LinkedIn Essentials

**Step 1: Create a LinkedIn account**

If you don’t already have one, sign up for a [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/). Be sure to use an email address that’s appropriate for professional communication.

**Step 2: Upload a photo**

Your photo can be a company headshot or a personal snapshot. Just make sure it’s not too informal or inappropriate. This photo will be your introduction to recruiters, and you want to make a good impression. When taking or selecting a photo, aim for the following criteria:

- Your face should fill the frame and be well-lit.
    
- You should dress as you would for work.
    
- Your expression should be relaxed and approachable—in other words, someone recruiters want to get to know.
    

**Step 3: Write your headline**

Your headline is the most prominent part of your profile, aside from your name. You can use your current job title here, but many people get creative with their headlines. You can use it to highlight your skills or describe your professional passions. Explore the profiles of other project management professionals to find inspiration.

**Step 4: Write your “About” summary**

The “About” section is similar to the professional summary of a resume, but it differs in two important ways:

- It can be (slightly) more general. Instead of tailoring your profile to a single job, search multiple job descriptions for keywords and patterns to include. Recruiters from many companies and industries will review your profile, so you don’t want to limit yourself.
    
- It can expand on your skills or tell a story. Your “About” can be a little longer than your professional summary. Use it to highlight your passions and skills—don’t be afraid to talk about yourself!
    

**Step 5: Add your experience**

Enter your work experience, including title, company, dates worked, and relevant accomplishments for each role. These should be similar to your resume bullets and use the P.A.R.I.S. framework (**problems** that needed to be solved, **actions** taken, **results** of those actions, the **impact** on the project, and any **supporting** evidence). As with the “About” section, you should adapt your bullets to accommodate multiple job descriptions.

**Step 6: Enter your education**

Include any degrees you hold, along with the institutions (your graduation date is optional). You can also add classes in relevant subjects and any capstone projects you completed. Listing activities or clubs you participated in can let recruiters know what’s important to you.

**Step 7: Add your skills**

Don’t forget to include any skills that highlight your strengths, talents, and proficiency in specific tools. These can be both technical and interpersonal skills.

**Step 8: Add your credentials and certifications**

Add any relevant credentials or certifications you may hold—including this one, which you can enter as “Google Project Management Certificate, expected [Month], [Year].” (**Note:** select a date format commonly used in your location.)

### Part 2 - Optional Elements

Now that you’ve completed your basic profile, consider including these optional elements:

**Step 1: Link to your portfolio**

You may think portfolios are only for writers or designers, but project managers can also showcase their work through portfolios. A good portfolio outlines the projects you’ve managed, artifacts you’ve created (if they are not confidential), your approach to problem-solving, and the positive outcomes of your work. If you have a portfolio, consider linking to it here.

**Step 2: Add your volunteer work**

Don’t underestimate the value of volunteer experience! It’s often a great way to get experience and demonstrate your project management capabilities. List any relevant volunteering you may have done and explain how you used your project management skills for good.

**Step 3: List your awards and honors**

If you’ve received any professional awards or honors for your work, add them to your profile.

**Step 4: Add your professional organization affiliations**

Professional organizations can be great networking tools, so be sure to list your current affiliations.

**Step 5: Add the languages you can speak and write**

If you can speak or write more than one language, don’t forget to include them. Language skills can be valuable to future employers.

**Step 6: Ask for recommendations and testimonials**

Ask colleagues to write testimonials that promote your skills, talents, and accomplishments. A personal recommendation can go a long way!

**Step 7: Upload a background photo**

In addition to your headshot, you also have the option to upload a background photo. A background photo is a great way to tell recruiters a bit more about yourself.

**Step 8: Upload a video**

If you’re good with a camera, a short video introduction is another option to engage people who visit your profile.

Compare the exemplar to your completed profile. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. Let’s review each of the profile elements:

**Photo**: Your profile photo should be professional, well-lit, and approachable.

**Headline**: Use your headline to highlight your skills or describe your professional passions. In our exemplar, Sophie uses, “Program Management Wizard.” How creative you can get varies by industry, so be sure to do your research!

**About/summary**: Similar to a resume summary, this section should showcase your passions and skills. In our exemplar, Sophie writes, “I enjoy finding creative solutions” to highlight their out-of-the-box thinking. 

**Experience**: A list of past positions, responsibilities, and accomplishments that tell recruiters what you can do. At the bookstore, Sophie “coordinated weekly readings and events, including author communication, marketing and social media, stock ordering, event setup and breakdown; events increased our visibility in the community, and increased store revenue 27% per event day.” Experiences like these often translate to project management, so don’t forget to include them.

**Education**: Any degrees you hold, including institutions and graduation dates, if you choose.

**Skills**: A list of skills that demonstrate your strengths, talents, and proficiency in specific tools. Sophie lists skills like innovation and problem-solving, along with WordPress and SQL.
