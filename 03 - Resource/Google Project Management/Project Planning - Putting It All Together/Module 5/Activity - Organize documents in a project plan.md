To pass this practice quiz, you must receive 100%, or 1 out of 1 point, by completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the [Course Overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/supplement/npdjx/course-3-overview).

## Activity Overview

Congratulations! You’ve come a long way and worked hard to complete all of the individual project planning documents, also known as project artifacts, in this course. In this activity, you will gather those documents and compile and organize them in one central place—your project plan. Having your documents in one place makes communication quicker, easier, and more streamlined, so everyone can find the information they need. 

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.   

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the project manager for Office Green’s Plant Pals Operations and Training plan launch, you want to keep all your planning documents organized in a central location. That way, you can easily share information and track the status of the project’s many moving pieces. Your project folders and labels should be clearly organized to provide visibility, continuity, and accountability.

A project plan is not only useful for streamlining team communications, it can also help you with retrospectives and planning for future projects.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SJDYOom0ThqQ2DqJtO4axw_9dad069929e7499ab585a6a7b09a29f3_graphic-line-Right.png?expiry=1715644800000&hmac=1qnM9EhwpByjjzvpu2gedq-3mBOnJNGHXMIrX9Hg4qA)

**Step 2: Add project details**

There are four tabs at the bottom of the template: **Dashboard**, **Project Schedule**, **Budget**, and **Communication Plan**. First, go to the **Dashboard** tab. You’ll use this tab to provide a brief overview of the project and link to key project documents. 

In the topmost section of the **Dashboard**, fill in the following information as indicated in the template:

- Project name
    
- Project description
    
- Project owner (You can use your name, make up a name, or simply write “Project Manager.”)
    
- Project status (mark the status as _Draft_ for now)
    

**Note:** Leave the descriptions of the **Key Docs** blank for now. You will fill them in once you complete the rest of the document. 

**Step 3: Gather project documents** 

Next, gather your main project documents from the activities in this course: 

- [Activity: Estimate a project plan in a Gantt chart](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/item/x6lkA)
    
- [Activity: Develop a project budget](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/item/20ucE)
    
- [Activity: Draft a communication plan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/quiz/hIkej/activity-draft-a-communication-plan)
    
- [Activity: Complete a Statement of Work (SoW)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/quiz/HyN4m/activity-complete-a-statement-of-work-sow)
    
- [Activity: Create a risk management plan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/peer/hOS6V/activity-create-a-risk-management-plan)
    

_Optional:_ Gather your finished documents from the following activities in the previous course, [_Project Initiation: Starting a Successful Project:_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/home/welcome)

- Project charter 
    
- RACI charts
    

**Step 4: Add the documents to their respective tabs**

Copy your completed Gantt chart, budget, and communication plan to the following tabs of your project plan:

- The Gantt chart spreadsheet should become the **Project Schedule** tab.
    
- The budget spreadsheet should become the **Budget** tab.
    
- The communication plan spreadsheet should become the **Communication Plan** tab.
    

If you are using [**Google Sheets**](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282959?hl=en), we recommend using the _Copy to > Existing spreadsheet_ function:

1. Open both your project plan and your source sheet (the spreadsheet you want to copy—e.g., your Gantt chart).
    
2. Copy your project plan URL.
    
3. Go to your source sheet and find the tab at the bottom (e.g., for your Gantt chart, this is the tab labeled “Gantt chart”). 
    
4. Click the down arrow on the tab and select _Copy to_ > _Existing spreadsheet_.
    
5. Paste the project plan URL into the bottom of the box that appears.
    
6. Choose _Select_ to copy the source sheet into your project plan.
    
7. The copied sheet will appear as a new tab at the bottom of your project plan. You can then delete the blank tab (“Project schedule,” “Budget,” or “Communication plan”) and rename the newly copied tab.
    

For **Microsoft Excel** or other **spreadsheet software,** you can drag a spreadsheet tab from one spreadsheet to another:

1. Arrange your spreadsheets so that both your project plan and your source spreadsheet (e.g., your Gantt chart) are side-by-side. (You may need to resize them first.)
    
2. Click the tab at the bottom of your source spreadsheet and drag it to the tab bar of your project plan.
    
3. The copied sheet will appear as a new tab at the bottom of your project plan. You can then delete the blank tab (Project schedule, Budget, or Communication plan) and rename the newly copied tab.
    

You can also [copy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/move-or-copy-cells-and-cell-contents-803d65eb-6a3e-4534-8c6f-ff12d1c4139e) all the cells of the source spreadsheet and then paste the content into the relevant tab in your project plan. 

**Step 5: Optional: Add hyperlinks to the Dashboard tab**

Next, you can add hyperlinks to your project plan tabs and other documents to the **Key Docs** section of the **Dashboard** tab. Creating links to the main documents in your project plan lets your team access them quickly and easily.

**Note:** If your project documents are not in the cloud or online, you won’t be able to link to them, and are not expected to do this step.

If you’re using Google Drive, follow these steps to [hyperlink](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) your **Project Schedule**, **Budget**, and **Communication Plan** tabs to the **Dashboard**:

1. Under **Key Docs** in the **Dashboard** tab, select the cell with the name of the document you want to link (e.g. “Schedule”).
    
2. Go to _Insert_ and select _Link_ (or select the _Insert link_ icon from the toolbar).
    
3. Choose _Sheets and named ranges_ and select the name of the tab you want to hyperlink.
    

To add hyperlinks to your Statement of Work, risk management plan, project charter, and RACI charts:

1. Copy the URL for the document you want to link.
    
2. Select the cell that matches the document you want to link (e.g., “Project charter”).
    
3. Select _Insert link_ and paste the URL.
    
4. Select Apply to link the document. 
    

If you want to create a shared folder so you can link to all your files, create a central folder on [Google Drive,](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310249?hl=en) or any other file sharing program (e.g., [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-files-and-folders-in-onedrive-personal-3fcefa26-1371-401e-8c04-589de81ed5eb), [Dropbox](https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/share/share-with-others) or [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/mac-help/set-up-file-sharing-on-mac-mh17131/10.15/mac/10.15)). Then, add the documents to the shared folder and generate a hyperlink to the **Key Docs** section of the **Dashboard**. 

**Step 6: Add descriptions**

In the **Dashboard** tab, write a short description of each document under **Description**. (Do this even if you haven’t created hyperlinks to your project documents. Your descriptions should be brief, but specific, so your stakeholders know exactly what each document contains.

**Note:** Be sure to adjust the sharing settings for your project documents and folders. To learn how to change sharing settings in Google Drive, visit [this resource](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7166529?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

**Step 7: Save your project plan**

Save your completed project plan to your computer or Google Drive. You'll need it again in the next course, [_Project Execution: Running the Project_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-execution-google/home/welcome)_._

### Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the project plan template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

Compare the exemplar to your completed project plan. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

**Project details in the Dashboard tab:** The Dashboard includes a project title, project description, project owner(s), and status. These details help you, your team, and your stakeholders keep track of the project. The **Key Docs** may optionally include hyperlinks to each project resource. Organizing documents in this way can make it easier to search for important information. It also helps your team keep track of project deadlines, tasks, and key project goals. 

**Document description:** The Dashboard includes brief, but specific, descriptions of each document. These descriptions provide context and help team members navigate the project plan.

**Document tabs:** The project plan includes tabs for all the main project documents. These tabs give your team easy access to important project files.

**(Optional) Shared folder:** The Dashboard tab may link to a shareable folder that contains all the project documents. This folder acts as a central resource for your team and important stakeholders.

**Accessibility**: Team members and stakeholders can access linked documents as Viewers or Commenters.

Remember, your project plan is a living document. You will update it regularly through the course of a project. You will add more documents and tabs as needed. You will also review your project plan regularly to make sure it is well-structured and organized for your team.

Congratulations on completing your project plan. You’ve demonstrated critical project management skills by creating effective project documents and organizing them in a centralized plan. Your work in this course will help you demonstrate your new skills to potential employers.
