To pass this practice quiz, you must receive 80%, or 4 out of 5 points, by completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the [Course Overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/supplement/npdjx/course-3-overview).

## Activity Overview

In the last activity, [_Use a WBS to create project tasks and milestones - Part 1_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/quiz/2UfFb/activity-use-a-wbs-to-create-milestones-and-project-tasks-part-1), you filled out a WBS brainstorm diagram with tasks and milestones. In this activity, you will use that diagram to complete a WBS spreadsheet. You will use this spreadsheet to assign tasks owners and sort milestones and tasks into sequential order.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

## Scenario

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hVmbXqU4TfaZm16lOP323g_e4c571928fbb4117a547fc86e8c5a886_line-y.png?expiry=1715299200000&hmac=nijWNSPHTMsGTc8bAWX0mJDt_Da0WHSMFR14OfDW0Qg)

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As a project manager for Office Green, you are developing an Operations and Training plan for the new Plant Pals service. It will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. You have already added milestones and tasks for this project to a WBS brainstorm diagram. Here are the milestones and their associated tasks:

- **Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan**: Team members will need to source materials for packaging and hire delivery drivers. They are also responsible for calculating the delivery fees. 
    
- **Select and install supply chain software and equipment**: Team members will supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software. They must also supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment and determine internal safety protocols for the equipment. 
    
- **Develop and launch an employee training program**: Team members will need to develop training sessions, train employees to use the software and equipment, and monitor employee progress and improve training processes.
    

Now you will add those tasks and milestones to a WBS spreadsheet. You will also use the sheet to record task owners and any notes about the tasks and their owners. The project sponsor for the Operations and Training plan, the Director of Operations, has put together a team for the operations launch. You can select task owners from among the following team:

- A **Financial Analyst,** who tracks and calculates costs and revenue
    
- A **Fulfillment Director**, who sources materials, ensures equipment is functional, and confirms fulfillment processes are correctly implemented
    
- An **Inventory Manager**, who maintains inventory and oversees software installation 
    
- A **Human Resources Specialist**, who manages hiring and develops training protocols (with the help of the Training Manager)
    
- A **Training Manager**, who reports to the HR Specialist, runs the training program on the established protocols, and refines training processes
    
- A **Quality Assurance Tester**, who ensures product quality and determines safety protocols and best practices

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SJDYOom0ThqQ2DqJtO4axw_9dad069929e7499ab585a6a7b09a29f3_graphic-line-Right.png?expiry=1715299200000&hmac=2eYy3FFIOBnTxogfzGsIiTxJRxW1RTWtBlZmxgGPWgs)

**Step 2: Add milestones**

First, open your WBS brainstorm diagram. Then record the three milestones from your brainstorm diagram under the **Milestone** column of your WBS Spreadsheet.

**Step 3: Add tasks**

Enter the tasks from your brainstorm diagram under the **Task** column of your spreadsheet. Write each task next to the corresponding milestone and task ID number. Assigning each task to an ID number helps you organize, analyze, and search for particular tasks as the list grows. Task IDs are especially useful for large or complex projects.

Task ID numbers tell you two things: 1) which milestone each task relates to and 2) the sequence of the tasks. So, task 1.1 is the ID for the first task of the first milestone. Task 1.2 is the second task of the first milestone, and so on. 

When you finish, you should have nine tasks in your spreadsheet—three for each milestone.

**Step 4: Add task owners and notes**

To the right of the **Task** column are columns for **Owner** and **Notes**. Here, you can record important details that didn’t fit into your WBS diagram.  

First, review the scenario and determine which of your team members should own each task. Then enter that person’s role next to the task in the **Owner** column.

Record any helpful details from the scenario in the **Notes** column. For example, including the description of the task owner’s role would remind you of each person’s responsibilities.

If you’d like, you can also add your best estimate of how long each task might take in the **Duration** column (this is optional). 

**Step 5 (Optional): Add tasks to Asana**

Many organizations use work management tools like Asana in addition to standard spreadsheets. Hiring managers might even ask you about your experience with work management software in interviews. That’s why we recommend recreating your WBS in Asana.

First, create an Asana account (if you don’t already have one). Then, create a project within Asana. Finally, add milestones for each assignment and add tasks to the milestones.

### Pro Tip: Save the Template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the WBS spreadsheet template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

Compare the exemplar to your completed WBS spreadsheet. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

Let’s review the WBS spreadsheet:

There are three milestones from the brainstorm diagram in the Milestones column and three tasks for each milestone (nine tasks in total). The project tasks correspond to the correct milestone ID number. The tasks are the same ones listed in the brainstorm diagram.

Each task has an appropriate owner, with corresponding notes for why the owner was assigned to the task:

**Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan**

1. _Source materials for packaging_: The **Fulfillment Director** sources materials. 
    
2. _Hire delivery drivers_: The **Human Resources Specialist** oversees hiring.
    
3. _Calculate delivery fees_: The **Financial Analyst** tracks costs and revenue.
    

**Select and install supply chain software and equipment**

1. _Supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software:_ The **Inventory Manager** ensures software is installed and set up properly.
    
2. _Supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment_: The **Fulfillment Director** ensures equipment is functional with the help of the Quality Assurance Tester.
    
3. _Determine internal safety protocols for the equipment_: The **Quality Assurance Tester** determines safety protocols and best practices. 
    

**Develop and launch employee training program**

1. _Develop training sessions_: The **Human Resources Specialist** develops the training sessions with the help of the Training Manager.
    
2. _Train employees to use the software and equipment:_ The **Training Manager** runs the training program on the established protocols. 
    
3. _Monitor employee progress and improve training processes:_ The **Training Manager** refines the training process.
