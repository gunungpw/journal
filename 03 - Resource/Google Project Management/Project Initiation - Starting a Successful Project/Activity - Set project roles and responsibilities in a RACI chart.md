## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the project manager for Plant Pals, you must assemble a team that can develop and execute the marketing and sales strategy to prepare for the launch. You must also assign roles and responsibilities for each of the project tasks and identify stakeholders impacted by the project. You’ve determined that the following people will be involved:

- **Director of Product:** Oversees the product offerings, and serves as a resource for marketing and sales questions. Their knowledge of customer needs is vital to the project. 
    
- **Marketing Manager**: Makes key decisions about the service launch and monitors task completion. They oversee all marketing efforts, including concept development, and sign off on the service launch plan. 
    
- **Marketing Coordinator:** Creates the marketing strategy, including all marketing assets. They work closely with the Copywriter and report to the Marketing Manager. 
    
- **Copywriter**: Produces all Plant Pals ad content, writes product descriptions, and creates promotional copy. They work with the Marketing Coordinator on all aspects of the marketing strategy and report to the Marketing Manager.
    
- **Head of Sales**: Sets Office Green’s overall sales strategy and tracks the company’s progress towards its sales goals. Their knowledge of customers’ buying behaviors can help the marketing team develop their campaign. The Head of Sales oversees the Sales Manager.
    
- **Sales Manager:** Responsible for customer outreach and relationship management strategies, so that Office Green meets its sales goals. They need to understand the final marketing strategy and product offerings and convey that information to the Sales team. The Sales Manager reports to the Head of Sales.
    

To develop and execute the marketing strategy and sales, your team must complete the following tasks:

1. Create a marketing plan for the new service
    
2. Write promotional copy 
    
3. Design marketing assets (e.g., flyers, brochures, and online advertisements)
    
4. Create a customer outreach and onboarding plan

**Step 2: Add tasks to the RACI chart**

Add the four tasks from the scenario to your RACI chart template under the **Task/Deliverable** heading. Replace “Task/Deliverable” with the name of each task.

**Step 3: Add team members to the RACI chart**

Add your team members to the template. Replace “Role A” with “Director of Product,” and so on.

**Step 4:** **Assign letters in the RACI chart**

For each task, assign the letters **R**, **A**, **C**, and **I** to the team members involved. Consult the descriptions below to determine how your team members relate to the tasks:

**Responsible:** Who is responsible for completing this task? Consider these questions when determining who is responsible:

- Which department manages the work?
    
- Who should perform the work?
    

**Accountable:** Who is accountable if the task isn’t completed? Remember that only one person should be accountable for each task or deliverable. When deciding who is accountable, ask yourself: 

- Who might delegate the task to another team member?
    
- Who makes final decisions about the task?
    
- Who should review the work to confirm it is complete?
    

**Consulted:** Who should be consulted for their insights, expertise, or strong opinions on the task? Here are a few questions to help identify whether someone should be consulted:

- Who can give feedback to responsible individuals to help them complete tasks? 
    
- Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?
    

**Informed:** Who should be kept informed about task progress or project decisions? Key questions to ask yourself include: 

- Who is invested in task completion but not directly involved in the work? 
    
- Who is affected by the project outcome?
    

_**Note:**_ _The number of stakeholders you keep informed about each task can vary depending on your situation. In some cases, you might choose to inform all stakeholders who aren't responsible, accountable, or consulted. In others, you could leave some cells in your RACI chart blank for certain tasks. Both approaches are fine for this activity._

### Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the RACI chart template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.
