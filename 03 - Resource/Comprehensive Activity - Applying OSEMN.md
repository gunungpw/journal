# Comprehensive Activity - Applying OSEMN

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review and finalize all the activities you have worked on throughout this course in weeks 2, 3, and 4. 

All of these activities are common tasks for a data analyst, and this is real-world practice. Completing this assignment and creating the corresponding documents is a valuable exercise. This assignment provides a realistic experience you can share with managers, recruiters, or educators to show your understanding of the OSEMN process. 

Take the time to review all the work you have completed and ask yourself the review questions for each part of the template. If needed, refine and finalize your responses in the template. Then, save all of your work so you are able to demonstrate to a potential employer the skills you have learned. 

## Activity Instructions

### Step 1: Access your activities

Open the template that you have been working in through this course in the following activities: 

- [Week 2 Exercise: Obtaining and Scrubbing Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analytics-introduction/assignment-submission/uLIeq/activity-exploring-and-modeling-data)
    
- [Week 3 Exercise: Exploring and Modeling Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analytics-introduction/assignment-submission/x1GrP/activity-obtaining-and-scrubbing-data)
    
- [Week 4 Exercise: iNterpreting Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analytics-introduction/assignment-submission/wZ9yB/activity-interpreting-data)
    

### Step 2: Complete any missing work

If you have not completed any of the sections for these activities, go back and work through them now.

### Step 3: Review Obtaining and Scrubbing Data

Did you answer the initial questions about the data analysis project? These questions are focused on the goals, KPIs, and data-gathering process. They include:

- In this scenario, what is a SMART goal that would benefit from data analysis? 
    
- What is a Primary KPI that would be useful to analyze for this goal? 
    
- What relevant data would you gather in this scenario? How do you imagine you could obtain this data? What sources would you gather data from? Specifically, note what kind of data (first-party, third-party) and what methods you might use (survey, web analytics). 
    

Did you answer the data validity and issue identification questions about the gathered data? These questions focus on the data's validity and the potential scrubbing that needs to be done. They include:

- Using what you know about data validity, do you think this data is valid? Why or why not? 
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 1 of the data? 
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 2 of the data? 
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 3 of the data? 
    
- What issue did you identify in segment 4 of the data?
    

### Step 4: Review Exploring and Modeling Data

Did you answer the exploratory questions about the data analysis project? These questions focus on the dataset features, potential visualization, and feature engineering. They include:

- What are some things you can tell about this dataset? For instance, what does the size of the dataset tell you?  
    
- What kind of data is in this dataset? (Numerical, categorical, etc.)   
    
- Reviewing this data, what is the minimum value in the order_total column? What is the maximum value in order_total column?  
    
- What chart would you use to help visualize this data?  
    
- Based on what you have learned, would you add an additional column to this dataset using feature engineering? For instance, would it be helpful to add the day of the week data using the sales dates?
    

Did you answer the questions about the charts in this data analysis project? These questions are focused on the construction of charts, what they show, and variable correlation. They include:

- Based on the data in this chart, what would be a good title for this chart?  
    
- What does this chart tell you about the number of orders in relation to the amount someone spends in their order?   
    
- What range do most of the orders tend to be in?  
    
- Do you notice any correlations between the variables in this chart? If so, what?
    

Did you answer the models in this data analysis project? These questions are focused on linear regression models, clustering models, and forecasting. They include:

- Reviewing this linear regression model, how many sales can be expected if the marketing budget is increased to $250?  
    
- Review these two linear regression models. The first shows the data that the model trained with, and the second is a test set. Is the model generalizable for this data? Why or why not?  
    
- Review this clustering model. A clustering algorithm has been used to identify two groups. What might you call the second group? Why?  
    
- You are trying to forecast BrightThreads sales in the coming quarter. What model might you use? Why did you choose this? 
    

### Step 5: Review iNterpreting Data

Did you answer the questions about the presentation of the findings in this data analysis project? These questions are focused on the content of a presentation as well as the storytelling tools used in the presentation. They include:

- What was the objective for this analysis?  
    
- How can Anna apply this in a business context?  
    
- What slides in the presentation covered the methods used in the project?  
    
- What slides in the presentation included visualization of the project?  
    
- What slides in the presentation offered recommendations after the project?  
    
- In your opinion, what parts of the presentation were the setup, buildup, climax, and conclusion? Why? 
    

### Step 6: Save your work

Save your work so that you can have this as an artifact in your portfolio.
