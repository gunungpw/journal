# Introduction: Interpreting Data

Welcome to the last week of our Intro to Data Analytics course, great work so far. You now know what's involved in obtaining and scrubbing data, as well as exploring and modeling it. So this week, we will focus on the last step in the awesome Framework, interpreting your analysis. Generating insights from your data is very powerful, and giving an interpretation to those findings, is where you can help the data tell a story. I think this is where a lot of the magic happens. Telling a story and convincing other people of your points is great. But if you can do that, backed up with data, it just makes you feel more powerful. This week, we'll highlight some of the ways in which you can do this. In the first lesson, we will take a look at what's involved in this interpretation phase, and how you can approach drawing conclusions from your analysis. Then in the second lesson, we will focus on how you can let your data tell a compelling story, a skill that you'll find very useful as a data analyst. And after that, we'll put all we learned about applying the awesome Framework together, in a real life example. We'll hear from Jules on how he used the awesome Framework, for a research project, to try and influence policymakers. You're in the final stretch for this course, so let's get right to it.
