Learning new skills takes courage. You must be willing to be a beginner, to experience the awkwardness of not knowing how things work. We are wired to seek comfort and avoid failure. **It may seem counterintuitive, but the faster you fail, adjust and try again, the faster you succeed.**

As a learner, if you are willing to step outside of your comfort zone, work through your fears and keep going as you acquire each new skill, apply what you learn, eventually you’ll become a pro!

# Find the Time

## Take Stock

This entire program is designed to be completed in **6 months** with an estimated **5-10 hours** dedicated to course work per week.

Before you set regular study times, it is helpful to understand how you spend your time. **Try to capture everything you do in a typical week.** Your hour spent at work, family obligations, classes or clubs, time spent on hobbies, exercise and socializing. If you want to get really detailed you can even capture the time you spend on social media or watching television.

## Prioritize

Once you know what you spend your time on you can decide what stays and what goes. **Ask yourself:**

- **What is set in stone?**
    
- **What is flexible or can be paused temporarily?**
    
- **What can you stop?**
    

The key to setting yourself up for success is to be realistic about how much time this program will take and how much time you can free up to give it the attention and focus necessary.

## Arrange Your Life

- **Identify your support system** - One way to make clearing your schedule easier is to enlist the support of your family, friends, and workplace where possible. They can provide much needed support and accountability. Plus, if they know that you are taking this course and what your goals are they will be more likely to be understanding when you prioritize your study time.
    
- **Set Boundaries** - Even with the most understanding of family members, significant others and friends, setting boundaries will sometimes be necessary. It can be hard to miss out on the fun, but committing yourself to your schedule and maintaining a consistent pace will ensure that you don’t lose momentum.
    
- **Set your schedule** - Look for or create regular blocks of uninterrupted study time. Consider cutting out tv and social media.

# Maximize Your Study Time

## Pomodoro Method

This well-known technique for managing your time and avoiding burnout was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. 

To put this technique into practice:

1. **Break your learning sessions into 25 minute periods separated by 5-10 minute breaks.**
    
2. **After four 25 minute sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break.**
    

That’s it! It sounds simple, and it is. Give it a try to help you stay in the learning zone longer and more sustainably.

## Active Learning

It is no secret that the more ways you experience new content the more likely you are to understand and remember it.  Active learning can take many forms including working through hands-on activities, labs and projects, engaging in a discussion or even teaching others. By design this program provides you opportunities to do all three. 

- If you choose to take the full course you can put your new skills into practice by completing the course projects. These not only help you apply what you are learning, your completed projects make a compelling portfolio to share with prospective employers. 
    
- Head to the discussion forums to share your thoughts and ideas with your fellow classmates. Discussing new concepts and hearing how others approach things can extend your learning.
    
- The discussion forums are also a great place to use your newfound knowledge to help other students who could use a little help. Teaching others a concept can really cement your learning and help you build relationships with what could be future colleagues.
    

## Connect Theory to Practice

Nothing cements new concepts like having the opportunity to put those skills into practice into a real-world exercise.

- **Spend some time on social media looking for accounts who are putting what you’ve learned into practice.** Being able to recognize the tactics and tools used by real practitioners is a great way to extend what you’re learning here and will allow you to continue to learn from others even after you complete this course. 
    
- **Complete the projects that are offered in this program.** They allow you to reinforce what you’ve learned and create valuable portfolio pieces in the process.
    

# Stay Motivated

## Understand Your Journey

As you’ll soon learn in this program, as a marketing analyst, knowing your ‘Customer’s Journey’ can help you understand what motivates them, how best to communicate with them and how to get them to take action.

As a student, you are also on a journey.  Learning new things is hard. At first, it’s exciting, but as you progress, it can be uncomfortable to risk failure, to be vulnerable and to persevere when the going gets tough. We all find ourselves in the ‘dark swamp of despair’ from time to time. When you recognize that’s where you are and can draw on your support systems and find ways to motivate yourself through these rough patches, you’ll eventually reach your goal!

## Eye on the Prize

- **Check-in with yourself** - can you pinpoint where you are? Excited about a new concept? In the dark swamp of despair? Climbing out? Sometimes acknowledging where you are allows you to course-correct and can keep you from getting off track.
    
- **Go back to the goals you set frequently** - post them somewhere conspicuous
    
- **Identify some things that help you stay focused and committed** - do them every time you sit down to work.
    
- **Post affirmations and gentle reminders to yourself in places you’ll see them.**
    

## Reward Yourself

Having something to look forward to and work towards can be a great way to push through periods of frustration or low motivation.

**Break your week down into a few milestones, such as:** 

- Finish all coursework for the week
    
- Complete x lessons by Friday
    
- Submit and respond to discussion prompts by Friday

- A special treat or meal
