We've looked at different ways you can explore your data and get an initial understanding of what the data will tell you. As you go through this exploration process, there's one additional step I would like to highlight: feature engineering. Before we dive in, let's quickly go over our dataset. It's a collection of sales data with features such as item name, quantity sold, price, and the date of sale. Each of these columns represents a unique aspect of the data we're analyzing. What we want to accomplish now is to extract more insightful information from this dataset. 

### What is Feature Engineering?

You might be wondering, what exactly is feature engineering? It's the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to better understand our data. It's the difference between having raw data and turning it into a well-prepared meal of insights. Often, data analysts will take this step before they start modeling. It lets them prepare the data to feed into the model in the right format. The importance of feature engineering cannot be overstated. It's like being a detective, searching for clues hidden within your data. Often, the most crucial insights are not apparent in the raw data. They can only be uncovered through feature engineering.

### Techniques for Feature Engineering

There are several common techniques for feature engineering. For instance, extracting information from dates and times, creating calculated features, and categorizing or classifying data. In fact, we touched earlier on the binning or bucketing of data, which is a form of feature engineering and a way to categorize data.

### Example: Sales Data

Let's look back at our dataset to explore how feature engineering works. We start with our sales data. 

#### Extracting Information from Dates

Say we're interested in finding the most common day of the week for sales. Although our current data doesn't directly answer this, we can extract this information from the date of sale feature. This is a perfect example of pulling more information out of an existing feature. You can do this using spreadsheet tools, which you will learn more about later.

#### Creating Calculated Features

Next, we combine our quantity sold and price features to create a new total sales feature. This is another step you can easily take using spreadsheets. Voila, we've just transformed our data in a way that could lead to more profound insights. For example, we can already see that our two highest total sales come from apples.

#### Categorizing Data

Finally, we can further categorize our data. For instance, we can group our day of the week data into weekday or weekend, allowing us to see trends more easily.

### Importance of Domain Expertise

Feature engineering isn't just about technique; it's also about understanding your field. We call this domain expertise. Why is domain expertise crucial? In our example, knowing that retail sales often spike during weekends might influence us to create a weekday or weekend feature. Understanding your field can help you to spot valuable new features that others might miss.

### Recap

Let's recap what we've covered. Feature engineering is a tool that lets us extract more information from our data, whether by deriving new data from existing features or combining features in novel ways. It's also important to understand your domain. This knowledge can guide your feature engineering efforts and help you identify the most meaningful features for your analysis.
