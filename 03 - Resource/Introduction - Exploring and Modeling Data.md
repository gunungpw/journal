Welcome to our third week in the intro to data analytics course. You already learned what's involved in obtaining and scrubbing data; now, we will move on to the exploring and modeling phases of the OSEMN framework! Data is your key to information. It helps you understand what's happening now, and it can reveal patterns that can help you predict what will happen the future. That's what makes data and data analytics so powerful. This week, you will learn how to unlock that power. In the first lesson, we will focus on data exploration, and you'll learn more about the tools and techniques that you can use to get to know your data better. Then we will move on to taking a closer look at a modeling phase. You'll learn what modeling is and how it's used by data analysts. And finally, we will look at an example in which we apply the exploring and modeling phase of the OSEMN framework. This is where you really start to uncover what your data are telling you. I can't wait to dive in!
