In the previous videos, we walked through the basic structure of Google Analytics and the data you can find in a Google Analytics account.  As you use Google Analytics, it is helpful to keep in mind that the reports you find in Google Analytics focus on three main areas. 

1. **Life Cycle**
    
2. **Users**
    
3. **Events**
    

Google Analytics Dashboard

## 1. Life Cycle

In the life cycle section, you will find data about how users come to your site or app, what content they engage with and which actions they take (potentially leading to monetization).  You can also find data here on whether people return to your site.  

## 2. Users

In this section, you can find data that give you a bit more insight into who your users are - their demographics as well as the tech they are using to access your site or app.

## 3. Events

This section specifically focuses on the actions that you have identified as important for your users.  You can see the number of conversions (which could be sales or other actions like for instance subscriptions to a newsletter) as well as the number of specific events that lead up to conversions.  

### Adjusting the reporting window

All reports you find in your Google Analytics dashboard will default to the last 7 days, but you can easily adjust the reporting window.

The real-time view gives you information about the users who visited your site or app in the past 30 mins.
