### Introduction to the Explore Stage

So far, you've seen the first two stages of the OSEMN framework: **Obtain** and **Scrub**. In the obtain stage, you gathered the data for analysis. Next, you cleaned the data during the scrubs stage by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and reformatting data to ensure consistent formatting.

### Explore Stage Overview

Stage 3 of the OSEMN framework, **Explore**, is all about getting familiar with the data. While you likely built some familiarity with your dataset during the scrub phase, the explore stage deepens your understanding by identifying patterns using tools like statistics and data visualizations. This step is crucial as it guides your analysis and helps you uncover the story your data tells.

**Exploration Objectives:**
1. **Understand Patterns:** Identify trends and patterns in your data.
2. **Guide Analysis:** Use insights to determine which analyses to perform next.
3. **Data Storytelling:** Begin to see the narrative your data presents.

**Iterative Nature of Data Work:**
Exploring your data often leads to revisiting earlier stages:
- **Scrub Stage:** Address additional dirty data issues discovered during exploration.
- **Obtain Stage:** Gather more data if needed.

This iterative process is typical and becomes more streamlined with experience.

### Common Steps in the Explore Phase

Let's explore the common steps data analysts take during this phase:

#### 1. The Language of Data
Understanding your data's structure and content is essential. This involves:
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and other summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and variability in your data.
- **Data Types and Ranges:** Verify that your data types are appropriate and that values fall within expected ranges.

#### 2. Data Visualizations
Visualizations are powerful tools to identify patterns and insights:
- **Histograms:** Show the distribution of a single variable.
- **Bar Charts:** Compare quantities across different categories.
- **Line Charts:** Track changes over time.
- **Scatter Plots:** Explore relationships between two numerical variables.

#### 3. Variable Distributions
Understanding the distribution of each variable helps identify:
- **Outliers:** Data points that deviate significantly from others.
- **Skewness and Kurtosis:** Shape characteristics of data distribution.
- **Normality:** Whether data follows a normal distribution, impacting statistical analysis choices.

#### 4. Relationships Between Variables
Identifying relationships between variables can reveal important insights:
- **Correlation:** Measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
- **Cross-Tabulation:** Analyze the relationship between categorical variables.
- **Pair Plots:** Visualize relationships between multiple pairs of variables simultaneously.

#### 5. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new variables that can better represent the underlying patterns in your data:
- **Aggregation:** Summarize data to highlight important trends.
- **Transformation:** Apply mathematical operations to improve data distributions or relationships.
- **Interaction Terms:** Combine variables to capture interactions that individual variables might miss.

### Conclusion

Exploring your data is a critical step in the OSEMN framework, setting the stage for more advanced analyses. By understanding patterns, distributions, and relationships, you can better guide your subsequent analytical efforts. The exploration phase also helps refine your dataset, ensuring it is robust and ready for deeper analysis.
