# The Hypothesis

All scientific research must start with a hypothesis. A hypothesis is just a tentative prediction about what the scientist imagines (through educated guesswork) to be the relationship between two ‘variables’. A variable is a factor that can be changed and manipulated in ways that are observable and measurable (more on this later). This prediction, which is based on either previous research or some other logical reasoning, can then be tested.

For example, I might want to study the relationship between ice cream consumption and the weather. My hypothesis might be that ‘the higher the temperature, the more people will purchase ice cream’. My variables would be temperature and ice cream consumption. This hypothesis is easily testable by simply measuring both the variables.

People sometimes confuse a theory with a hypothesis. A theory predicts events in general terms, while a hypothesis makes a far more specific prediction about a particular set of circumstances. A theory is developed after extensive testing, while a hypothesis is an educated guess that has not yet been tested. A hypothesis can lead to a new theory, or to proving an existing one.

When talking about hypotheses, there are a couple of other terms that readers might come across. The ‘null hypothesis’ is the suggestion that there is no relationship at all between two or more variables. This is the default option that a piece of research will usually aim to reject (unless the research is aimed at proving there is no relationship). In the ice cream example, the null hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between ice cream consumption and outside temperature (which would probably be rejected by the findings).

Other terms in psychological research that you should be aware of are ‘one-tailed’ or ‘two-tailed’ hypotheses. Put simply, a one-tailed hypothesis specifies the direction that the predicted effect will have, whereas a two-tailed hypothesis does not specify the direction at all.

Thus:

- One-tailed: Increased outside temperatures will lead to increased consumption of ice cream.
- Two-tailed: Outside temperature will be related to ice cream consumption.

One-tailed hypotheses are used when we are pretty sure of the direction we are expecting, while two-tailed hypotheses are useful when we expect an effect but are not entirely sure what that effect might be.
