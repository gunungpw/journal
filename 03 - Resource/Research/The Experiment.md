# The Experiment

Once a psychology researcher has their hypothesis, they will need to test that with some kind of experiment. An experiment is what we do to test hypothesized relationships between variables. These experiments can be very complex with many different variables, or fairly simple cause-and-effect studies. Even a simple experiment will be made up of various components:

- **The experimental hypothesis**: this is the statement that predicts what effect is expected (see above) and is not simply a guess, but is developed by examining previous research or literature in the area.

- **The variables**: These are the factors that are to be measured or manipulated in the experiment. There are two types of variable – independent and dependent. The independent variable (IV) is the thing that you change or manipulate and it is this change that you expect to lead to the hypothesis effect. The dependent variable (DV) is the factor that changes as a result of the IV. For example, if I were to conduct an experiment to test my ice cream hypothesis (above), I could manipulate the temperature (IV) in a shopping mall and measure how much ice cream was purchased (DV) at different temperatures. The amount of ice cream bought is dependent on the temperature in the mall.

- **The control group**: to carry out a rigorous experiment, it is necessary to have two groups of participants in the study: those who are subject to the manipulation of the IV and those who are not. Thus, I would need to measure ice cream consumption on a group of shoppers where the mall is kept at a constant temperature. This is the control group, and controls for the possibility that extraneous variables might have accounted for the findings. Extraneous variables are those unexpected factors that might influence the outcomes. For instance, there may be factors that influence ice cream consumption other than temperature, such as shop displays and time of day. The control group allows these extraneous factors to be controlled for.

- **The experimental group**: this is the group receiving the treatment or intervention and can be compared to the control group.

Once the data from the simple experiment has been collected, the researchers will perform a number of statistical tests to determine whether any differences found between the control and the experimental group are statistically significant (or whether they could have occurred by chance).

We could make the experiment more complex by adding another IV to the mix – or another DV. Another IV might be placing adverts for ice cream around the mall to see whether this affects ice cream consumption. Another DV might be a measure of which flavours or types of iced treat are preferred.

An experiment could also involve either independent or repeated measures. In the ice cream example, we are comparing different groups of people in each condition, experimental and controls – the two groups are independent of each other and thus this is an independent measure. We could do, however, a repeated measures experiment where we use only one group of participants; for example, we could, in theory, measure ice cream consumption before increasing temperature, during, then again once the temperature went back to normal.

Of course, this would make no sense as most people don’t eat that much ice cream! But imagine a different experiment, such as one to measure the effect of violent computer games on aggression in children; here, an independent measures experiment would have one group of children play the games and one group play non- violent games – and then compare the amount of aggression between the two groups. A repeated measures experiment would take a baseline measure of aggressive behaviour of one group of children, have them play violent computer games, then measure aggression again. Here the measure after the intervention would be compared with that before it.
