# Victor: First job experiences

My first IT job I was essentially a glorified spam filter. They hired me part time to go through the spam folder and then find anything that got mislabeled the spam and forward it to people's inboxes. So I did that for about a week and then I was like this is insane, there is no way that huge companies are paying people to sit in the back of the room and do this. So I started installing at the time, I was like spam assassin is like open source mail filter. Yeah, and then I basically like automated that away and I told my boss about it and I was like hey this is like we don't need this anymore, I don't need to do that anymore. So then I started doing other things and I'm like I would create new accounts that would delete all accounts. And I kind of just did that. I grew into eventually becoming like the full time sys admin for for the company there. When I graduated I started looking at other large companies that I might be excited to work for. So Google was one of them and I threw my resume together and I sent it over for one of the IT jobs that they had here and I didn't really think I was going to get it. I was literally in the means of moving to Seattle when they told me like can you start in four weeks? So I had to figure it out. I had four weeks to change my plans entirely and I started here and I learned like what IT really looked like in a huge environment.
