# Supplemental Reading for ReFS File System

Microsoft is currently developing another filesystem called ReFS, it isn’t quite ready for consumer use, but if you’re interested in learning more you can read more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS).

**Heads up:** A big part of being successful in an IT role is the ability to be a self-led learner -- someone who finds key resources and reads up on the latest tech trends and solutions. The supplemental readings we’ve provided have been designed to show you just some of the support materials available to you online; they’re not meant to be considered a comprehensive list. Feel free to add to the conversation by posting other useful resources for learners to the discussion forum.
