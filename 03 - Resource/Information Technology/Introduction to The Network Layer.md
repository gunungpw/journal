# Introduction to The Network Layer

Computers are able to communicate across massive distances at near instant speeds. It's a remarkable technical advancement at the root of how billions of people use the internet every single day. Earlier in this course, we learned about how computers communicate with each other over short distances or on a single network segment or LAN. In these next lessons, will focus on the technologies that allow data to across many networks, facilitating communications over great distances. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the IP addressing scheme and how sub netting works. This means you'll learn how to perform basic math and binary in order to describe subnets. You'll also be able to demonstrate how encapsulation works and how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate. And finally, you'll gain an understanding of the basics behind routing, routing protocols and how the internet works. For now, route yourself to the next video and we'll get started.
