## Healthy habits for course completion

Here is a list of best practices that will help you successfully complete the courses in the program: 

- **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and following them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to set achievable goals. Find a space that allows you to focus when you review the videos and readings, and complete course activities.
    
- **Work at your own pace:** Everyone learns differently, so this program has been designed to let you work at your own pace. Although your personalized deadlines start when you enroll, feel free to progress through the program at the speed that works best for you. There is no penalty for late assignments; to earn your certificate, all you have to do is complete all of the work. 
    
    - **Note:** If you need more time to complete a section of the course, you can simply extend your deadlines. When your session ends, select **Switch Schedule** to begin a new course schedule. You won't lose any course progress, and you can reset deadlines as many times as you want.
        
- **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, explore the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The steps you take to support your learning will advance your knowledge, create more opportunities for you in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs.
    
- **Take notes:** Notes will help you remember information in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
    
- **Build your career identity:** Your career identity is the unique value you bring to the workforce. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbT4qMrot4) to learn about the key components of career identity and write your own career identity statement. Discovering and defining your own career identity makes you better equipped to choose a career path that aligns with your strengths, values, and goals and is more effective in your chosen profession.
