# VPNs: Legal or Illegal?

VPNâ€™s main task is to add an extra layer of privacy and security to online activities. VPNs can be used in a variety of ways:

- Governments and corporations use VPNs to secure their workplace
    
- VPNs can help secure personal data while using public WiFi
    
- VPN s can conceal illegal activity, such as stealing copyrighted material
    

Because some, unfortunately, do use VPNs for illegal matters, some countries have made the use of VPNs illegal. Other countries allow the use VPNs if no illegal activity is being done while using one.

Do you think the legitimate uses of a VPN outweigh the negatives? Share your opinions with your classmates.
