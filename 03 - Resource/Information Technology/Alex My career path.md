# Alex: My career path

I think a big misconception that a lot of people have about IT, or tech work in general, is that it's complicated or that it's difficult, or that only some small subset of people are capable of handling these tasks. None of that is true. These are very specific skills that you have to know and that's absolutely true. Maybe it's true that most people don't have these skills, but that doesn't mean that people can't learn. IT is incredibly stable. You have the opportunity to make a very good living. You have a ton of directions that your career can go. So many people I know started off in desktop support and are now network engineers or site reliability engineers or software engineers. It's an industry that's not going away. It's only growing. There's always going to be opportunities. I studied philosophy and history and actually also minored in creative writing. While some of those skills are absolutely transferred and allow me to excel at my job. I didn't learn anything about the technical aspects from my time in college at all. I've never taken an academic computer science course. I've never taken a course in networking. I've never taken a course in anything related to computers in any way whatsoever. Education is important, but there are other ways that you can learn the skills that you need to have a successful career in IT, in tech.
