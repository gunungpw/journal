# Cindy: Drive and career path

I'd say when I first started I thought there were two jobs you could do, you could be a sys admin or you could be IT support. But that's completely false. There's like a huge amount of opportunity in IT. You could be specialized in networks. You could be specialized in databases or like reliability engineering. I'd say it doesn't matter if you're a guy a girl an alien ideas for everyone. It's just problem solving with technology and anyone can do it. I know people who are in IT that degrees in liberal arts or like cooking and all these other things. People come from IT from all sorts of backgrounds. I've always drive to be different. And for me I think that was just learning skills like growing up girls didn't use computers. I was like Igirl relly use a computer? Girls didn't know how to drive manual cars. I'm going to go learn how to drive a manual car. They don't know how to ride motorcycles. I can do that too. And I enjoy learning I enjoy learning a lot of things. I enjoy picking up new skills. Technology is a real equalizer for people who don't have the current educational like background. You can load up a website. All these learning websites. There's so much information on the Internet and I think that technology really equalizes that for people who want to get into certain careers. They want to learn something. I think what's available now is amazing and I think I wish I'd had that ten years ago when I started.
