# Taking Tech Apart

Have you ever taken apart a computer or a remote control? Have you wondered what's inside your phone or toaster? You can learn a lot by taking stuff apart and putting it back together again! In fact, taking tech apart is an important part of an IT Support Specialist's job.

If you have ever taken apart tech before, share your experiences with your fellow classmates! What did you take apart and why? What did you learn when you did so? Did anything surprise you? Were you able to put it together and get it working again?

If you never have taken apart a piece of tech, would you consider doing it now? Why or why not? Share your thoughts with the group!
