# Sabrina: Technology can open doors

Technology can open doors and allow you to achieve things that even you didn't expect. Growing up, I never pictured that I would be in technology, right? I didn't ever even expect to go to college. I don't think that it's about college. I do think that you need to be interested in learning. You need to be willing to push yourself, question assumptions and challenge other people. I've worked with a lot of people who have not gone to a four year college, and have been incredibly successful at google and at other large companies and small companies even that I've worked for here in Silicon Valley. Being willing to acknowledge what you don't know, but being interested in be like, okay, I don't know that, but I can figure it out or I want to see if I can figure it out. Testing your boundaries and pushing yourself, really will drive your success beyond what you think you could achieve.
