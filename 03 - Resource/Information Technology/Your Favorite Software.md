# Your Favorite Software

Video games, music players, and internet browsers are all different types of software that have completely different functions. Think of the apps you use on your phone or your computer.

Now that you understand how software works, think about your favorite software applications: do you look at this software any differently now that you know how it work? Do you use software any differently now? Why or why not?

Share your favorite types of software with your classmates and see what applications other people are using!
