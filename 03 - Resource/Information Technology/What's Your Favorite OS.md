# What's Your Favorite OS?

Think about all the different tech devices you use: your phone, your home computer (if you have one), computers at school, computers at work, computers in movies, television etc.

What types of operating systems have you used before? Which types of OS have you not used before? Which ones are your favorite and why?

Share your experiences with your classmates and see which OS others prefer to use!
