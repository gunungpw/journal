# Putting it All Together: Adding Graphics and Other Peripherals

Let's go back to our massive connectors. There are few things I would like to highlight. This big one right here. This is the one that house our motherboard. Another one that we have, it's more of a legacy one is for pin Molex. These connections were used heavily before SATA came out. Now we use these connectors to power majority of the SATA devices today. Most modern machines today will probably use SATA connectors for your hard drives. It may come with Molex to SATA adapters. Now, it's time for the fun part. First, let's go ahead and connect our power supply to our motherboard. That's this big pin, as we discussed earlier. It's going to go in right here.

Plug that in like so.

Next, we're going to go ahead and power the CPU with this pen right here. Pretty tight, but you should be able to get it in.

There you go. What we just did was we have the power supply is powering the motherboard and the CPU. Now that we've hooked up to cable to our CPU and motherboard, next thing that we need to hook up are these cables that are sitting in our case. This is going to vary from case to case, but let's go through it. Some of these cables are used for your cases, buttons, and lights. For this one, I'm going to plug these in.

Our case cables are now secured to a motherboard. One good idea is sometimes your motherboard will come with some guides. This will help you fasten your cables to your motherboard so it's clean and tight on your case. I'm just going to go ahead and do that right here.

Now that we have our cables securely fastened to our case, let's not forget one more thing, how graphics card we'll need that so we can upload a video to our monitor. We're going to plug this graphics card into our PCI Express lot on our motherboard. Just like the RAM, you are going to put a little bit of pressure when you insert the same. Don't feel bad by putting a little bit of pressure and you hear a click like this,

which you've done it, you can tightly secure it to your case. This is going to vary from case to case.

There you go. Your graphics card has been installed. I think that's it. Let's cover up our computer. First make sure you take your anti-static bracelet away.

Get our case put that in like so. Just plug. That's it.

There you go. We finally built our machine. Last, but not least, let's connect our monitor keyboard, mouse to the desktop. First, let's get our keyboard. We're going to do is going to connect this USB to the USB port on our desktop.

Want to get our mouse, do the same thing, connect this to our USB port then finally, we're going to go ahead and connect our monitor. For this monitor we're going to go ahead and use a display port cable. Want to connect one end to our desktop like so. Next I'm going to plug this into my monitor.

This is the most interesting part. Let's see if all this works. I'm going to power it on, I got blue light, which is good, off course it's going to vary from system to system. Let's see if something shows up on the monitor. Computer is booting up. Let's see. It looks like the monitor is receiving signal. Just good it. There we have messages. Success, there we go. It's working perfect. If you're having issues with your computer not starting up, that's okay. Check that your power supply can supply the correct amount of wattage or make sure your connectors are in the right place. Oh, what's this non-system disk or disk area replace and strike any key when ready. Looks like our disk doesn't have an operating system to boot into. No worries. That's what we'll be discussing in the next set of lessons. We'll learn what an operating system is, and what the main operating systems are and how to install one. Well, good job. You've got your computer up and running and it monitors were seeing signal so that's it. Let's take a moment and think about what you just did. Not only did you learn about each component of a computer, but you figured out how they work individually and then we built one together. It's quite an accomplishment.
