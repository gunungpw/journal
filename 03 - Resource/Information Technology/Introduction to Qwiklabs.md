# Introduction to Qwiklabs

You're about to do a few exercises using the Qwiklabs online learning platform. Before we dive into that, let's learn a bit more about the platform. Qwiklabs is an online learning environment that takes you through live real world scenarios you may encounter as an IT support specialist. As we said earlier, a virtual machine or VM, simulates computers using software. This virtual machine will be running on either Linux or Windows depending on the exercise. Qwiklab supports both, this way you can learn to work in either operating system regardless of which operating system you are running on your machine. The Qwiklabs virtual machines run in the cloud. So you can access them over the internet from wherever you are. As we've shared before, when we say that a service is running in the cloud, we mean that it's running in a data center or on other remote servers. After this video, we'll give you instructions on how to access and complete the labs. You'll use Qwiklabs in lots of courses for this program. So spend some time learning your way around it. We still encourage you to try these exercises on a local machine if that's an option for you. Remember that practice makes perfect, whether you're learning something new or trying to improve your skills. So practice using Qwiklabs as much as you can.
