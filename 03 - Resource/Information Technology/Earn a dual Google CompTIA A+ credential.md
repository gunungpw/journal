# Earn a dual Google CompTIA A+ credential

**Did you know? The Google IT Support Professional Certificate prepares you for the industry-standard CompTIA A+ Certification.**

Google has teamed up with [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/blog/the-new-comptia-a-your-questions-answered), a nonprofit trade organization that’s widely recognized in the IT industry, to offer a new dual credential. The material covered by the Google IT Support program, not only provides you with the skills to enter the field of IT Support, but also prepares you for the industry-standard CompTIA A+ certification exams. The benefits of having both the Google IT Support Certificate and CompTIA A+ Certification under your belt include:

- Getting your foot in the door while applying for IT roles - 96% of HR managers use IT certifications as screening criteria for recruitment. 
    
- Future-proofing your career and advancing in your role - Demonstrating continuing value to their employers, CompTIA certified IT professionals are promoted almost twice as often as non certified IT professionals.

This badge can be posted on LinkedIn to make your profile stand out to employers and is aimed to help open the door to IT support roles.
