# Supplemental Reading for RFCs and Standards

In the video about **non-routable address space**, we introduced the concept of an RFC, or **Request for Comments**. RFCs started as a way for academics to discuss how their computers might talk to each other.

An RFC would be published, people would leave comments, eventually a consensus would be formed, and a new standard would be developed.

Over many decades, RFCs have come to belong to the IETF, or [**Internet Engineering Task Force**](https://www.ietf.org/), which is an open community charged with developing and maintaining the standards required for the Internet to continue to operate.

You can browse the impressively large collections of RFCs [here](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/).

By the way, RFCs [have a long history of April Fool’s Day jokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_Request_for_Comments). My personal favorites are [RFC 1149](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149) and [RFC 3514](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3514.txt), both of which might be funnier once we’ve tackled the next module.
