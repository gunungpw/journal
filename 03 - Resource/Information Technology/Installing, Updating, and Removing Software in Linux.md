# Installing, Updating, and Removing Software in Linux

## Introduction

This lab will teach you how to perform basic software maintenance on Linux machines. This includes installing software that's not already present on the machines, updating existing software to the newest version, and uninstalling software that‘s no longer needed. All of these tasks are very common in the IT world, so it's important that you're able to do them quickly and effectively.

### What you'll do

There are three learning objectives for this lab:

- **Update**- The machine you'll be using comes preinstalled with an old version of the VLC Media Player. You'll update VLC to the newest version.
    
- **Install**- You'll install the Mozilla Firefox web browser. There's currently no version of Firefox on the machine you'll be using, so it will be a fresh installation.
    
- **Uninstall** - You'll uninstall the GIMP photo-editing tool from the machine, removing it entirely.
