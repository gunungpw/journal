# Tri Ngo: How to overcome obstacles and become successful in IT


The IT world is not that scary. So let me give a little example of where I'm from. So I'm from an underprivileged family who immigrated here to the US. So I had a language barrier. Access to technology was also a barrier. I mean back in the day I didn't have access to it and I worked hard to deal with all these obstacles. And right now I think people are quite lucky because there are economic opportunities. There is technological resources out there that are available on the internet. A lot of them are in formats that people are more than willing to share their opinion and share their solutions and share their knowledge. So I think everyone is fortunate to have these resources available to them now. And I think that opens up opportunities to all of you. I think that it's okay to make mistakes. We're all human, it's okay to fail and then learn from those failures and not to give up. For example, when I launched a web page for my first job there were a lot of errors that were showing up in the JavaScript that I had written and everybody was able to see that. I fixed them very quickly and in the end I was able to produce something good. And I was able to learn about troubleshooting and how to fix bugs on the web page and it was really quite beneficial.
