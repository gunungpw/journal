# Alex: My success story

So at one point I was working for a managed service provider which is basically a company that provides IT support for other companies. And we were helping one of our clients migrate some of their systems onto a new version. And every time I tried to start one of their services, it would just error out and crash and kernel dump on the screen and we couldn't figure out why. And eventually we get support for the third party that actually writes this piece of software on the line and they can't figure it out and it gets escalated and escalated. And eventually I have the personal phone number of the vice president at this company who's the person who first wrote this software. And him and I spent several days trying to figure out what was going on to no avail. We tried running this on different servers. We tried everything we could possibly think of until I realized that the license key that needed to be in place for the software to work have been copied over from a Windows machine onto a Linux machine. Which means that the characters used at the end of the line to signal this line is over, please move on to the next one, were different. This software was choking on this difference break line character. All I had to do was run one command and switch it over to a Linux file format and everything worked 

Also two weeks of my life lost but we leave out exactly how long.
