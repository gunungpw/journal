# One program, many futures

One of my favorite parts of the program, was showing me how many different jobs have an IT department or use some aspect of IT. You can do pretty much anything, it's very motivating. The feeling of growth, is an amazing thing, having felt stagnant for so long, working at what I had considered to be dead end jobs, with no real vertical movement, and knowing that now you can advance, you can put yourself into so much more. Don't think about what you think IT is, think about all the possibilities or the expansion that IT actually goes into. The program was great for me, it gave me more understanding of what IT is and all the different opportunities you can get into, and I can go into hardware, I can go into cyber security, and that's the best part because it's not just keeping me grounded to one level. I am able to go further. This program, would definitely be the way to go to get your foot in the door, to learn and do more in this field that you're interested in. It has the basic fundamentals, it gives you the building blocks, and from there, the sky is the limit.
