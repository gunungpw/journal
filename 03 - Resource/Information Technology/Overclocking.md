# Overclocking

Have you ever "overclocked" a CPU before? Maybe you did this for your computer to make a better experience for video games.

If you've done this before, share your experiences with your classmates! How did you learn how to do this? What tutorials or guides did you follow to do it?

If you've never overclocked a CPU before, do you think you would try it now? Where would you start? Maybe you can learn a thing or two from your classmates who have tried this before :)
