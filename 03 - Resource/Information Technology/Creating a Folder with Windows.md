# Creating a Folder with Windows

## Introduction

This lab will introduce you to the Qwiklabs online learning platform’s hands-on lab experience. You'll interact with hands-on labs in lots of courses of the IT Support Professional Certificate program, so it's important that you follow these instructions carefully. We'll give you some background information about what Qwiklabs are, and how these labs will help train you as an IT Support Specialist. Finally, you'll interact with the lab materials themselves. Ready? Let's get started!

**Heads up:** The grade is calculated when the lab is complete, so be sure to hit "**End Lab**" when you're done!

In this Qwiklab, you'll spin up a virtual machine of the Windows OS. In other Qwiklabs throughout the IT Support Professional Certificate, you may spin up other _instances_ (or other occurrences) of software; Qwiklabs isn't just limited to operating systems. You'll soon learn that, with Qwiklabs, you can interact with many other real-world scenarios that you may see as an IT Support Specialist.
