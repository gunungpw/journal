# Qwiklabs guidelines and troubleshooting steps

Throughout this certificate, you will use Qwiklabs through Coursera to complete hands-on activities that include troubleshooting, networking, operating systems, and systems administration tasks. Qwiklabs is an online lab tool that creates simulated Windows and Linux OS environments, allowing you to use both Linux and Windows operating systems as if they were installed on your local machine. When you access labs through Coursera you will be given the software and OS setup needed to complete the lab.

In this reading, you’ll find guidelines that will help you use Qwiklabs successfully. Additionally, you’ll examine some troubleshooting steps you can take if you encounter any difficulties using Qwiklabs on your computer. Finally, we’ll provide resources you can access if you encounter any issues you cannot resolve on your own.  

## How to use Qwiklabs successfully

Follow the guidelines below whenever you begin a lab.

1. **Access the lab directly through Coursera** (not through the Qwiklabs catalog). If you do not access labs directly through Coursera, you will not receive a grade. 
    
2. Select the “**Start Lab**” button to begin the lab.
    
3. **Allow time for the lab to load**. Qwiklabs are launched in an interactive Cloud environment and take some time to load, often several minutes. Additionally, you may experience some delays when the Linux and Windows simulated environments boot up.
    
4. **Notice the time allotted for the lab**. Unless stated otherwise, you will have 60 minutes to complete each Qwiklabs assignment. **If you don’t finish the lab in the allotted time, you’ll need to restart the lab from the beginning.** 
    
    1. **Note:** Qwiklabs cannot save your work because each time you begin a lab, temporary credentials are created for you to connect to the lab. These credentials expire at the end of the lab assignment. 
        
5. **Allow the Qwiklab and browser read access to your computer’s clipboard**, if you feel comfortable doing so. This will allow you to copy and paste commands from the lab into the virtual environment you’re using within Qwiklabs.
    
6. **Once the lab has been running for at least 5 minutes**, select the “**End Lab**” button for your grade to be sent to Coursera. Qwiklabs communicates your grade to Coursera when you select “**End lab**”. 
    
    1. **Note:** The lab needs to run for **at least 5 minutes** for your activity’s score to be shared with Coursera. If you click the "**End Lab**" button before 5 minutes have passed, your score may be recorded incorrectly in Coursera.
        
7. **Use the right browser.** Make sure your internet browser is up-to-date. Qwiklabs requires the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. If your browser is outdated or not supported by Qwiklabs, you may encounter a problem. If your browser is up to date and you are using one of the browsers listed above and still encountering problems try restarting your browser or clearing your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode which prevents your browser from storing cookies and other temporary data. 
    
    1. **Note:** The Qwiklabs user interface works best with Google Chrome. 
        
8. **Use a stable internet connection.** If you are experiencing problems starting or completing Qwiklabs your internet connection may be too slow or unreliable. Some signs of an unstable internet connection may be freezing labs, difficulty connecting to virtual machines, or the inability to type or enter commands within the lab environment.
    
    1. **Pro tip:** If you are unable to complete a Qwiklab on one device, try using another device. 
        

## Troubleshooting steps

If you encounter a problem or error message while completing a lab, make sure you’ve followed the steps and guidelines above. If you have followed all the guidelines, try the troubleshooting steps below.

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of a supported browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.
    
2. Restart your browser and clear your browser’s cache and cookies. You can also use incognito mode.
    
3. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable. You can try restarting your router and modem to regain a stable connection.
    
4. Try restarting Qwiklabs.
    
5. If you receive a message stating that you have exceeded the quota for a Qwiklab, submit this [form](https://qwiklab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Qwiklabs support for assistance. When you submit the form: 
    
    1. Use the email address you use to access Coursera.
        
    2. Provide the link to the lab and the title of the course.
        
    3. Ask the support agent to reset the quota so you can retake the lab and complete the Google IT Support Certificate.
