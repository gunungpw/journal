# Alex: Why networking is important


Every computing device that we interact with on a daily basis is a network device. Computers aren't stand-alone anymore in any way. From our phones, to a tablets, to a laptops, to a desktops, they're all networked in some way. They're all talking to other computers. To a lot of people networking is seen as some black magic and only certain people really understand what's going on. But in my experience, an IT support person who truly understands networking at a fundamental level, is just able to perform every aspect of their job so much more successfully. There are a lot of networking courses available. This is actually something that people have been teaching in this manner since the 90s. But I think this course is really different because it focuses on so many practical cases, as well as really focusing on the things that an IT support person needs to know and not necessarily a network engineer. We spend time on DNS. We spend a lot of time on different troubleshooting techniques and tools. We spend a lot of time just focusing on the things that on a day-to-day basis, someone in IT actually needs to know about.
