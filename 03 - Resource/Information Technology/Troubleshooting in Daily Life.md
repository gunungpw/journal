# Troubleshooting in Daily Life

"Troubleshooting" is a tech term for solving a problem. But chances are you've already done some troubleshooting in your daily life!

What are some examples of troubleshooting that you've experienced? What were you trying to fix and why? When you were doing it, did you think of it as "troubleshooting" or not? If you did the same activity today, would you think of it as "troubleshooting" now?

Share your troubleshooting experiences with your classmates and see what other people did to solve those problems!
