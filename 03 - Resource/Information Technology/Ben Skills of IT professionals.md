You've got to have curiosity, you've got to have a lifetime of curiosity and a dedication to a lifetime of learning because the tools and technology that we use in this industry are always going to be changing. Great tech skills are really important but the important thing about technology is that it serves people and it serves the interests of people. You have to like people you have to like helping them, you have to have empathy and sympathy for their problems. That is the most important thing.

They're going to be relevant to everything that we do in our lives for as far into the future as anyone can predict, try this program out.
