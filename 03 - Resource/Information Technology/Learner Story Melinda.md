# Learner Story: Melinda

The world changes. Things change. I was cleaning up the other day, and I was throwing away old disks from our first computer, those little floppy disks. Nobody use that anymore. But I thought floppy disks were cool back then. So if I weren't a lifelong learner, I'd still be stuck like that floppy disk. I believe it's never too late to go in a new direction, and I think IT is my thing. I think that's going to be my thing.
