In this reading, we’ll take a look at some prominent industry groups,  what they do and their approaches to privacy. 

In previous lessons, you’ve been introduced to the Digital Advertising Alliance.

Every company, industry group, and organization we’ve talked about here understands the importance of consumer trust and the value of information in data driven advertising. 

When consumers feel like their privacy isn’t being taken seriously, they might become frustrated or resentful- no brand wants consumers feeling that way.  Take a look at any of their resources on privacy and you’ll find similar themes: the importance of consumer trust and the benefits of data-based marketing. The digital advertising space is a still young and ever-evolving landscape, but these groups are working hard to stay current with new laws and regulations.
