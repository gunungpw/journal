Welcome to your next week. This week is all about data and privacy. Access to data is important for marketers. It makes it possible to target advertising messages to the right audience, optimize marketing campaigns, and measure the outcome of marketing action. But we shouldn't forget that all that data is related to user behavior and while users may be okay with sharing some data, there are limits. And as a marketing analyst, it's important to understand where the limits are and how to work with data responsibly. So this week we will answer questions like who owns a user's data. What are the limits on its use? And how is the privacy of users protected? First, we'll look at data from the consumer's perspective. In the first lesson, we'll take a look at what data consumers frequently provide and how that allows for free online content consumption. We will then have a look at how consumers can control the amount and type of data they share. Once we've looked at privacy from the vantage point of a consumer, we will dive deeper into the value of personal data to an advertiser. We will discuss the use and ownership of data, as well as the responsibility advertisers have to guard the trust of the users. Finally, we will discuss how user privacy is protected and what rules we, as advertisers need to adhere to. I'm excited to get started on this lesson, so see you in the next video.
