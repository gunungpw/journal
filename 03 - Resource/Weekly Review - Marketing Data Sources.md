Congratulations, you finished another week in the Facebook Marketing Analytics Professional Certificate Program. You accomplished a lot this week. First, you learned about different sources of data marketers use. You now know that marketers use both offline and online data. And you also understand that in some cases, it isn't realistic to work with all the data for a particular event, in which case you can turn to sampling. You also learned what marketers mean when they talk about first, second, and third party data. And you know which tools marketing analysts use to collect data about online user behavior. You learned about browser cookies used to collect web browsing behavior data, pixels or tags to collect event data on specific websites, SDKs for data on app usage, and you learned how APIs are used to connect data from different sources to online platforms. And finally, you saw how Imra at Calla & Ivy uses all these tools to collect the data she needs for her marketing. Now, you know which data sources you can tap into for different data needs, and you know which tools to use to collect online data for different use cases. Given how many different data sources there are, knowing when different data collection tools apply is incredibly helpful. Now, you're ready to start looking into the tools you can use to categorize and analyze all that data. That's what's next. See you there!
