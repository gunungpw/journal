# Explain, Enlighten, and Engage

In previous videos, we talked about the importance of storytelling with data. In this video, we'll talk about the steps in identifying and creating a story from our data. After you've analyzed your data and drawing your conclusions, you will often need to present your findings. You'll want to make sure that you can convey your findings well and persuade people to understand and believe that. In order to tell a persuasive story, we need to focus on the three Es; explain, enlighten, and engage. This can be achieved by a combination of data, narratives and visuals. Both the data and a narrative will serve to explain the situation. The narrative provides context for the data, specifically, where it comes from, why stakeholders should care about it and what was done with it. Data and visualization are part of enlightening your audience, as we've mentioned before, raw data are simply a bunch of values. It's hard for most people to appreciate what the data I have to say in their raw form. By combining the data with good visuals, one can show clearly what the data are and what they mean to the overall big picture. You want to lead your audience to that aha moment to point where everything clicks. Engagement comes from the narrative and visualizations. If the visualizations are good and the narrative is clear and concise, people can internalize what's being said. This internalization gets them invested in the story. As the Venn diagram shows all three parts together, the data visualizations and narrative can lead to audience understanding and persuasion as they're brought together using the three Es of explain, enlighten, and engage. That's frequently the goal of the story.

Suppose you're presenting data on decreasing honeybee populations. You have data on the global decline in honeybee populations over the last decade gathered from various environmental research agencies. This data includes annual honeybee colony counts across several countries. You prepare a story around the importance of honeybees in the equal system, highlighting their role in pollinating a majority of the food crops we consume. You discuss the potential consequences of their declining numbers and why it matters to everyone, not just environmentalists. You create a line graph that vividly illustrates the decrease in honeybee populations over time across different countries. This visual representation allows for a clearer understanding of the magnitude of the problem. The numbers alone would illustrate. Now, how do these elements combine to explain, enlightened, and engage? You use the narrative to clarify the data's origin and its significance. Stating disfigures derived from multiple environmental agencies showed the alarming rate of decline in honeybee populations over the past 10 years. The visual of the line graph is used to illustrate the data. You'd see this graph powerfully depicts the downward trend allowing us to visualize the severity of the issue at hand. Finally, you combine the narrative and visuals saying, imagine a future where many fruits and vegetables becomes scarce due to the lack of pollination. This graph isn't just lines and dips. It represents potential problems to our food supplies that might need to be addressed. This makes the story memorable and drives home the urgency of the issue. In future videos, we'll go deeper into data storytelling and how to tell an effective and compelling story. For now, remember that a good data story persuades your audience by transforming the data into stories that explain, enlighten, and engage.
