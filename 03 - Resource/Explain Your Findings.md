# Explain Your Findings

Let's continue our discussion of the interprets stage of the OSEMN process. This is where all the data explorations and number crunching finally pay off. This is also where we explain our findings and generate concrete recommendations for our organizations. Now that we've explored the entire OSEMN process to understand our model, we want to make the hard numbers tell a story. It needs to be a story that anyone in our team, not just the data experts can understand and act upon. This is a crucial step because it's not just about having insights, it's about communicating them effectively. An essential aspect of effective data storytelling is choosing the right medium to communicate your findings, and there are many different mediums you could use. Some examples could be a slide presentation or an interactive notebook, or an in-depth report for an executive review. Each of these comes with its own strengths and challenges, and being able to adapt your story-telling approach to fit each medium is an important skill in data analytics. For the purpose of our discussion today, we will concentrate on slide presentations, but these lessons largely apply to any other medium you use. Slide presentations are universally relevant across industries and job roles and provide a structured, visual and engaging way to take your audience through your findings and recommendations. Your presentation should recap the original goal, review how you went through the steps of the OSEMN cycle, visualize critical data points, and importantly, explain your findings and recommendations. Let's talk about the key components of an effective slide presentation. Start your presentation by taking your audience back to the original problem that initiated your analysis. Re-introduce the issue at hand. What were we trying to solve? Why did we consider it necessary to undertake this analysis? Highlight the potential implications of not addressing this issue, illustrating why it was significant enough to warrant such an in-depth investigation. The purpose of this segment is to establish the context, helping your audience comprehend the relevance of the forthcoming findings and recommendations. Now that you've established the context, take the audience through the method you used. In this example you're going to take the audience through the steps of the OSEMN process that was followed. You want to maintain high-level overview, provide enough context for each step so the audience can understand the methods that lead to the insights. Remember, the goal here isn't to dive into highly technical details. You simply want to build a clear picture of the process leading up to your findings. If you're presenting to a more technical audience though, you might want to include more of the technical details. Now, guide your audience through a visual tour of the data, using aesthetically appealing and easy to understand visuals such as graphs, charts, and tables. You should try to encapsulate the core data points that lead to your findings. Make sure these visuals are accessible to a broad audience and designed in a way that even non data analysts can comprehend. The role of visualizations it's not just to display data, but to make the data speak for itself. Highlighting trends, anomalies, patterns, and correlations that underscore your findings. With visuals presented, it's time to describe them for your audience. This is where you act as the translator, decoding the visuals and turning data into a narrative. Elaborate on the key observations drawn from the data, explaining what they signify in the context of the original problem. Try to link the patterns and trends into visuals to the story you're trying to tell. Make sure your explanations are straightforward and relatable so that the audience can easily understand the story coming from the data. As you approach the end of your presentation, present your recommendations based on the findings, what actions should be taken to address the problem identified at the beginning of the presentation. If your data reveals a potential for improvement or modification in certain areas, outline those recommendations clearly. Discuss why you believe these steps would make a difference. Drawing connections between your findings and the recommended actions.

Let's imagine we've been analyzing a recent decline in web traffic for an e-commerce store. We start our presentation with a recap. We remind the audience about the initial problem; a significant drop in website traffic over the past three months, which we noticed during our routine metrics review. Next, reshare the OSEMN process. We obtained website analytics data, scrubbed it to ensure accuracy, then explore that to identify trends and anomalies. Our exploration led us to the modeling phase where we created a model that identifies potential costs. We then present a visualization, a graph illustrating the downward trend in website traffic alongside the increase in page load time, which we discovered was the primary cause for our model output. The clear inverse correlation visually substantiates our key finding. We can use the graph to explain what happens and when the problem started. As the page load time increased, the web traffic decreased significantly. We're able to tell the story of how our users started leaving our website because of longer low tides causing the website traffic to decline. And finally, we conclude with our recommendation. Given the correlation between page load time and traffic, we suggest optimizing the website's performance in an effort to reduce low time, which should help recover and possibly increase our website traffic. Thus, our data journey comes full circle, offering actionable insights that can be used to improve our business. Interpreting your findings and explaining them effectively to your audience is what turns data into action. It's the crucial final step in the OSEMN cycle, one that bridges the gap between raw data and real-world decisions, and that's the power of data analytics
