### Importance of Data Source

- **Validity and Reliability**: Knowing whether data is first or third party helps assess its validity and reliability.

First party data offers more control and insight into its accuracy, while third party data can provide broader, often more comprehensive insights but requires careful evaluation to ensure its reliability.
