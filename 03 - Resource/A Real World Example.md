# A Real World Example

In previous videos, we followed Keira, a data analysts working with Carlos, the owner of Inu and Neko, a dog and cat care company. Carlos had approached Keira to help and launch a new subscription meal service for cats and dogs and wanted to select the 10 best products to offer as part of the subscription. Keira started by obtaining the necessary data from their e-commerce software. She downloaded last year's sales data into Google Sheets to analyze which products were most popular and purchased repeatedly. She obtained the data properly by making sure it was credible, collected accurately, objective, accurate, and relevant to Carlos' questions. Keira proceeded to scrub the dataset, checking for duplicates, inconsistent formatting in the zip codes, and missing values like phone numbers and sales totals. She standardized zip codes for consistency and remove the phone number column because it was not crucial for analysis. Keira filled in missing sales stores by calculating product price multiplied by quantity. Some records lacked customer IDs, preventing the assessment of repeat buyers. So Keira deemed them unhelpful and removed them from the dataset. Lastly, she identified inaccurate information such as negative sales amounts and unusually high prices, recognizing them as glitches in Inu+Nekoâ€™s system and excluded them from consideration to maintain data accuracy for future analysis. Now that Keira has completed scrubbing the data successfully while addressing duplicates, inconsistencies, proportionate gaps, and inaccuracies, she's ready to dive into our next topic; explore and model. In the explore and model stages of the OSEMN Framework, Kiera is now tasked with uncovering patterns and trends within the data and creating a model to predict subscription bundle preferences for Inu and Neko's customers. During the explorer stage, Keira will perform various exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights. This might involve using charts and visualizations to identify correlations between different product categories or demographic segments. She'll also dive deeper into customer behavior by analyzing purchase frequency, average basket sizes, and seasonal trends. Once Keira has explored the data thoroughly. She can move on to modeling. Modeling involves using algorithms to create a predictive model based on historical data. Keira will develop models to help Carlos meet his goal of hitting 500 subscriptions. In the upcoming videos, we'll follow Keira through the explore and model stages of the OSEMN Framework! Let's get started!
