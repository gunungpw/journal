# Is this course for me?

# Dear learner,

thank you for taking the time to look at this course. Please take a look at the following to understand what you are going to be able to do after completing this course, who this course was designed for and to ensure you are getting the most out of this course.

## Why Supply Chain Logistics?

Logistics is defined as the movement and storage of goods, services, and related information. Therefore, the study of logistics is essential in today's global interconnected supply chains, where we can bring companies together through transportation, warehousing, and inventory management.

## An Introduction to Logistics

In this introductory Supply Chain Logistics course, I will take you on a journey to this fascinating backbone of global trade. Please note that the idea for this course is to introduce learners to logistics. While I am planning to cover the most important pieces, this is not meant to be exhaustive nor should you expect to be an expert upon completion. But my goal is to show the major pieces of logistics in a fun manner and hopefully this will encourage you to learn more.

### What topics will you cover?

We cover the three major building blocks of logistics networks:

- Transportation
    
- Warehousing
    
- Inventory
    

### What will I be able to do upon completing this course?

- After completing this course, you will be able to differentiate the advantages and disadvantages of different modes of transportation.
    
- You will understand what goes into designing and setting up a warehousing facility.
    
- You will be able to select the options that enable you to develop logistics networks, that minimize costs and deliver top customer service.
    

### Who is this course for?

This introductory course is designed for three general audiences. While this is not an exhaustive list, you should be able to see yourself in one of these three groups:

1. Those of you who are exploring a career in Supply Chain Management, but lack the any background. This course will provide you with a general overview of the field of logistics.
    
2. Those of you who are working with people in logistics and want to understand their daily challenges better.
    
3. Those of you who are fascinated by how the products, services, and information are moved and stored in a complex global logistics network.
    

### What do I need to start?

This is an introductory course designed to provide you with a start on your learning journey in logistics. We are going to cover logistics from a US perspective (this is where I live). As such, you do not need to have any background in logistics, but it would be beneficial if you had a basic understanding of:

- General business concepts
    
- No math necessary!
