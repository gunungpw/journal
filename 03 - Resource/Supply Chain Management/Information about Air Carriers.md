# Information about Air Carriers

# Air Carriers

## Lecture objectives

1. Understand how air carriers operate
    
2. How air carriers compete
    
3. Look into the future of the industry
    

## Lecture Summary

### Operations

- All-cargo airlines are operating similar to TL - you rent the entire plane.
    
- Commercial airlines are able to carry smaller quantities as belly cargo - similar to LTL.
    
- Parcel carriers are also using planes for small shipments - but they are often very expensive.
    

### Rates

The rates in air transportation are often a mystery to many. While the rate is quoted by weight, the actual rate charged corresponds to that weight if the package has a certain density. This is also known as the [volumetric density](http://www.emeraldfreight.com/online-resources/freight-volumetric-calculations).

So what happens when it is not the 'right' density?

- If it is less dense, then you get charged for the volume translated to the corresponding weight
    
- If it is heavier then you pay for the actual weight
    

### Competition

- Fuel costs: who can best manage the largest expense and hedge against future price increases
    
- Who can manage the delays put on by security concerns. Technology is starting to help alleviate these issues.
