# Warehousing Best Practices

## Streamline the picking process – reduce order pick time

- Place most frequently picked items closest to the shipping areas. Also, consider the frequency of orders, rather than the overall amount of products. You should also review sales data constantly to ensure that the items are stored closest to the shipping area are still the most frequently picked.
    
- Locate the highest-demand items within each storage area on the most convenient storage space (for example: floor level for pallets in racks and between waist and shoulder level for bins in racks).
    
- Consider difficulty of retrieval for workers and shorten it as much as possible.
    

## Implement efficient dock management practices

- Dock space is some of the most critical space in the warehouse.
    
- All material must flow in and out of your docks, and they are limited in number (and not readily added to).
    
- Space on inside and outside of docks is some of the busiest in warehouse.
    
- Receiving dock becomes a choke point in the supply chain.
    
- Docks in today’s warehouses must be more flexible and must support a variety of receipts that are coming in at a faster rate and in greater frequency.
    

## Add automation wisely

- Use forklifts that enable workers to move pallets and larger items.
    
- Make the most of conveyor belts, sorters, and automated packing stations. These tools not only improve efficiency, but they also increase speed and ensure picking accuracy.
    
- Be careful not to overdo it with technology. Once put in place these expensive automation systems typically cannot be easily upgraded and changed.
    

## Maximize vertical space

- Take advantage of every inch of available space (floor to ceiling
    
- Pallet racking lead to safer working conditions as well as increased efficiency.
    

# Technology

### Implement Warehouse Management Software (WMS) to sequence orders and organize the workflow inside the warehouse

- Organize the workflow and optimize sequence performance.
    
- Sequence your orders by pick path
    
- Batch pick single lines, same-zone orders, and difficult picks (e.g. non-conveyable items).
    
- To make the most of your WMS, provide your workers with hand-held RF readers telling them what and how many
    
- to pick at each location.
    

### Implement pick-to-light systems

- Operator scans bar-coded label attached to a box.
    
- Systems informs operator of the item and quantity they need to pick.
    
- These systems work best for your top 5% to 20% products.
    

### Pick-to-voice systems

- System informs operator of pick instructions through a headset.
    
- Enables workers to pick orders without looking at a computer screen or paper pick tickets.
    
- Warehouses have adopted voice-based picking to complement the pick-to-light systems (for fastest moving products).
    

# Examples

In the lecture, I have shown you a traditional warehouse layout. We are going to improve on it a little by changing some features around. As a reminder, here is the traditional layout:

After changing around certain pieces, here is a better warehouse layout:

### The most significant improvements over the traditional layout

- Notice how we have two docking areas, one on each side of the building. This enables us to focus on each task in the best way possible - without impeding on each other. We also gain two staging areas which improves the flow into and out of the warehouse. We do give up some storage space, but in this case it is a good trade-off to make since the staging areas are typical bottleneck spots that hinder the efficient movement of products into and out of the warehouse.
    
- We also turned the racks so they run along the long side of the building. This approach usually improves space utilization.
    
- We increased the space provided to the case lot/ fast movers compared to the other storage areas. Since most of our time is spent on fast movers, it is more efficient to allot them more space.
    
- The conveyor belt system is more elaborate, but we have extended it for easier access from the end of each isle.
    
- The miscellaneous areas are combined and moved to one side of the building as to not impede on the flow within the warehouse.
    

### Can we improve this even further? Here are some ideas

- Access into the case lot / fast movers area is impeded by the conveyor belt.
    
- The conveyor belt should have access to the end of each isle.
    
- The inbound staging area does not extend over the entire row of dock doors.
