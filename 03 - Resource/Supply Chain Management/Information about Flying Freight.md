# Information about Flying Freight

# **Flying Freight**

## **Lecture Objectives:**

1. What makes air freight attractive to shippers?
    
2. Cost structure is majority fuel and equipment
    
3. What kind of equipment is used?
    

## **Lecture Summary:**

**Air Freight Service Characteristics**

When importance of speed outweighs cost, then air is attractive for freight!

- Emergency shipments
    
- Typical commodities include mail, communications products, racehorses, etc.
    

Speed of service considerations

- Speed, travel time advantage can be off-set by flight frequency and timing
    
- Smaller communities have experienced reduced frequencies
    
- In-direct routing due to hub and spoke networks
    

**Cost Structure**

_The industry operates at: high variable costs (70-90%), low fixed (10-30%)_

- _Government support of highway structure_
    
- _Terminals not too capital intensive_
    

**High variable costs (about 60% of total, but can be as high as 80%)**

- About 30% attributable to flight operations
    
- About 12% for maintenance
    
- About 17% for aircraft and traffic servicing
    

**How to deal with fuel costs:**

- Increases have major impact on operating costs
    
- More fuel efficient aircraft and smaller planes on low-density routes
    

**Types of Equipment**

_We need different planes for different purposes._

**All cargo**

- Extra-large planes
    
- Wide body
    
- Narrow body
    

**Belly cargo**

- Existing airliners
    
- Smaller loads â€“ maybe a few containers
