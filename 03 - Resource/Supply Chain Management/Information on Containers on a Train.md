## Lecture Summary

### What is intermodal?

Most products have the ability to trade time versus cost. As a basic rule - if the cargo comes in full containers then it is a good candidate for intermodal. The key to intermodal is the use of containers and its seamless transfer from one mode to another. Think about it this way – if we can easily move freight from one truck to another then we can simply substitute another mode of transportation that is more efficient on that part of the lane - the cargo in the container stays untouched.

**Advantages:**

- On long distances rail transportation has a significant advantage over truck in terms of fuel efficiency – which translates into a large cost advantage.
    
- On long distances (over 500 miles) rail is not much slower than truck
    
- Accessibility: by combining the advantages of rail and truck, the freight can reach any spot a regular truck could reach
